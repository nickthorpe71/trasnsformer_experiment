 [Old Woman]
   Long, long ago, the El Nido
   Archipelago was ruled by
   6 great dragons...

   Now the final battle between
   those sleeping dragons,
   humans, and Fate is about to
   begin...

   When the time comes, Serge,
   on whose side will you stand?

 [Introductory Cutscene]
 
   What was the start of all this?
   When did the cogs of fate begin to turn?
   
   Perhaps it is impossible to grasp that answer now,
   From deep within the flow of time...
   
   But, for a certainty, back then,
   We loved so many, yet hated so much,
   We hurt others and were hurt ourselves...
   
   Yet even then, we ran like the wind,
   Whilst our laughter echoed,
   Under cerulean skies...

   Serge......

 [Marge]
   Good morning, Serge!

 [Marge]
   Come on, sleepy head!
   Get up!
   
Marge:
   Good morning,
   Serge.
   You're finally up.
   The sun's already
   reached high noon.
   
Marge:
   By the way, didn't you
   have plans to meet with
   Leena this morning?
   Leena came by to see if
   you were up, but you,
   young man, were still
   off in never-never land.
   You shouldn't break
   promises like that.
   Girls can be pretty scary
   if you make them angry!
   
Marge:
   Weren't you supposed to
   meet Leena this morning?
   Hurry along now and
   go apologize to her.
   Don't expect me to stick up
   for you if Leena ever
   decides to blow you off.

Marge:
   You wouldn't want that, right?
   ~~~She'd never do that!
   ~~~That would be bad...

Marge:
   My, aren't we confident?
   If only you could
   keep it up.

Marge:
   Then get your priorities
   straight, and let her
   know how you feel.
   Understand?
   Tomorrow is a new
   day. Who knows
   what will happen...
   
Marge:
   Hurry along now and
   go apologize to Leena.
   
Marge:
   You want to give
   that to your mother?
   I think there's someone
   else out there who would
   appreciate that even more.

Poshul:
   Me will do anything you

   Me will use my Pretty-

   Me will do it,

 [Radius]
   Hmm? What do you have there?
   Oh? Is this what all the
   young 'uns are crazy about
   these days?
   Hoh-hoh-hoh! That is great!
   Back in my day, we used
   to collect Heckran fangs.
   I guess every generation
   has its favorites, and
   I guess we play alike, too.
 
Radius:
   Oh, Serge,
   how goes it?
   How would you like
   to join everyone
   for my lecture?
   Today's lecture is
   '"The Fundamentals
   of Attack and the
   Art of Elements."'

Radius:
   How about it?
   Would you like to
   join my lecture?
   Today's lecture is
   '"The Fundamentals
   of Attack and the
   Art of Elements."'

   ~~~Sure
   ~~~Maybe next time

Radius:
   Excellent!
   A true man,
   you are.
   Well then, let's
   get on with it.

Radius:
   ......!
   You're way too advanced
   for my lecture!
   Keep up the good work,
   sonny.

Poshul:
   Then Me will watch
   from here.
   Good ruck!

Radius:
   Pooped already, eh?
   And you're still so young...
   Oh well, don't let
   it get you down.
   Come again anytime, sonny.

Radius:
   Well now, did you
   find it helpful?
   Come again, sonny.
   I promise to take
   it easy on you!

Radius:
   You've learned well,
   sonny.
   You'll do just fine.

Radius:
   Oh? It does not
   interest you?
   Oh well...
   Come again, sonny.
   I promise to take
   it easy on you!
 
 [Radius Battle]

Radius:
   Hoh-hoh-hoh...
   C'mon \[Member] ?\!
   Don't hold back!

Radius:
   First, here's some basic advice on
   attacking, so listen up young'un...!
   You know that the three different
   attack levels -- Weak, Strong,
   and Fierce -- each have differing
   accuracy, or \'"\HIT%\"'\ values, don't you?
   Every time you hit your opponent,
   each of these values increase to
   make it easier for your next
   attack to hit its mark!
   A good strategy is to start with
   Weak(1) blows, which have the highest
   chance of succeeding, and then build
   up to Strong(2) and Fierce(3) blows.
   So, rather than attacking willy-nilly,
   you should aim to build up your HIT%.
   If your Fierce(3) attacks don't hit
   home, you're just wasting your energy!

   Weak!

   Strong!!

   Fierce!!!

Radius:
   Hoh-hoh-hoh! You're not even close!
   Don't be trusting in your HIT%
   too much there, boy!
   As long as it's not 100%, you
   still run the risk of missing
   continuously, don't you!?
   Sometimes it pays to muster
   up the courage to use Strong(2)
   and Fierce(3) attacks straight
   from the start, too!

   Fierce!

   Fierce!!

Radius:
   Next, let's check out the use of
   Elements!
   When you use an Element, the
   color of that Element's attribute
   remains on the battlefield in
   the form of the \'"\Field Effect!\"'\
   Each time you consecutively use
   the same-colored Elements, the
   effectiveness of that colored
   Element group increases!
   Here, I'll show you...
   Let's fill up all the Field Effect
   attributes with the color blue!
   Try using a blue Element after me...

   Radius:
   See! The field is completely
   blue now. Any blue Elements you
   use now will sure pack a punch!

   Here! Try this out...

Radius:
   Hey there! Hurry up and turn
   all the Field Effect attributes
   blue, for crying out loud!
   Don't you know how to use them
   Elements or something, young'un?
   If that's the case, then listen
   up, boy! It takes some explaining!

Radius:
   First, you've got to choose \'"\Attack\"'\
   to do some physical damage to your
   opponent in order to get started!
   Weak(1), Strong(2), and Fierce(3)
   attacks each add 1, 2, or 3 points
   to your Element Power Level.
   Your current level is the number
   that appears above the \'"\Lv\"'\ symbol
   under your name there, son!
   Oh, I nearly forgot to tell you!
   You won't accumulate any power
   unless you actually succeed in
   hitting your opponent...
   So be careful!
   You can't afford to miss!

Radius:
   Discharging this accumulated
   power is what using Elements is
   all about!
   Once you've built up some power,
   you will be able to choose the
   \'"\Element\"'\ option from the battle
   menu.
   When you select the Element option,
   gray-colored rectangular plates
   appear on the screen, don't they?
   Those plates are the Elements you
   currently have allocated.

Radius:
   So...why don't you try
   using one of those blue
   Elements you have there, boy?
   Relax! They won't disappear when
   you use them... You just won't
   be able to use them again for the
   rest of this battle, that's all!
   Once you enter another battle,
   you'll be able to use them again.
   So don't hold back now...
   But even though I say this, I
   still have to stress that you've
   got to consider the appropriate
   time to use your Elements.
   Otherwise, you'll never be able to
   beat some of the harder enemies
   you're bound to meet! You've got
   to form the proper strategy, boy!

Radius:
   Oh, but wait! I'm forgetting
   something important...
   (It must be my old age!)
   There are some Elements that
   disappear in a puff of smoke each
   time you use them! The Element
   \'"\Tablet\"'\ is just one example!
   These are called \'"\Consumable
   Elements,\"'\ and they have the symbol
   \'"\\Object\\"'\ in front of their names. These
   don't regenerate after each battle.
   However, the benefit of such
   Consumable Elements is that you
   can allocate up to five of these
   into the same Element Grid space.
   Doing so allows you to use several
   of them in the same battle, unlike
   Basic Elements, which normally can
   only be used once in any one battle.
   That is why Consumable Elements also
   have a number such as \'"\x5\"'\ after
   their names. That's the number you
   currently hold in that Grid position.
   This number will decrease as the
   Elements are used up for good.
   However, after each battle, you can
   restock more for use next time.

Radius:
   Anyway, enough about that.
   More about actually using Elements...
   I'm sure you'll notice that each
   time you use an Element, your
   Element Power Level (as shown by
   the \'"\Lv\"'\ number) will go down.
   It's just simple subtraction, really!
   For instance, say you're currently
   at \'"\Lv 3\"'\ and you decide to use a
   "\Tablet\"'\ Element allocated at
   "\Lv 1\" in your Element Grid!
   In this case 3 minus 1 leaves 2.
   So your current Element Power Level
   will now be changed to \'"\Lv 2\"'\!
   You can use Elements anytime, so long
   as your Stamina value is above 1.0.
   So in this case, you'll still be
   able to use Elements with a Power 
   Level of up to "Lv 2" right
   after using the "Tablet" Element!

Radius:
   Did you get the gist of it, sonny?
   Now do you see the importance of
   developing good battle tactics?
   You could build up a little power, then
   use an Element, build up a little more
   power, then use another Element...
   repeating this over and over. That's OK!
   Or you can build up your Element Power
   to its maximum level and unleash a
   barrage of Elements, one after another.
   That's no problem either!
   Use whatever strategy you think will
   work to defeat each of the enemies you
   come across.
   It's up to you.
   There are hordes of monsters out there
   that you'll never be able to defeat by
   physical attacks alone! You're going to
   need to master Elements to get by, boy.
   Well, sorry for the long lecture there,
   sonny. My explanation about Elements is
   officially over...
   Why don't you try and use one now?

Radius:
   What's this? You still haven't
   managed to fill all the Field
   Effect attributes blue yet?
   What, you expect an old man
   to do everything for you?
   You slacker!
   Anyway, here we go...

Radius:
   Hoh-hoh-hoh!
   Was that too much for you?
   Sorry about that, young'un!
   Conversely, when there is a lot of
   blue in the Field Effect attributes,
   the Elements of the opposite color,
   red, will be weakened!
   So try to discern your enemy's
   attack pattern and fill the Field
   with the opposite color of his
   attacks as a form of defense.
   This strategy of using Elements
   is sure to come in handy, so put
   it to good use, sonny!

Radius:
   Hoh-hoh-hoh...
   How was that?
   You learn something there, boy?
   Anyway, I guess it's time to
   bring this lesson to an end.
   Here you go...
   Hah!
   
 [Toma]
   Yo, my name's Toma the 14th!
   But people usually put
   '"The Great Explorer"'

The Great Explorer Toma:
   I was just looking around
   for treasure...
   I have a sixth sense, you know.
   Yo! I wasn't gardening!
   I...uhhh...was really
   looking for treasure!
   
The Great Explorer Toma:
   Believe me, kid!
   This ain't gardening!
   I'm real busy.
   Now go away!
   Go on, scoot!

The Great Explorer Toma:
   What is that?
   A Komodo dragon scale?
   Hah! That doesn't
   interest me one bit.
   Run along, kid.
 
 [Chief's Hut, Arni (Home)]

Ash:
   We came all the way out here in
   search of the legendary treasure,
   but our funds ran out...
   Once I'm done cleaning in here,
   I have to do some yard work.
   We gotta do something to
   cover our expenses...
   If I knew this was going to
   happen, I would've tried to
   persuade Sir Toma to look for
   treasure on the Zenan continent...

[Kid]
   Yippieee!!!

Leena:
   You're late, Serge.
   Sleeping in as usual,
   I suppose?
   You promised you'd go
   get some Komodo dragon
   scales for my necklace,
   remember?
   Since you were late,
   my mom asked me to
   baby-sit the kids!
   
 [Kid]
   Whoo-hoo!
   Sergey, Leena,
   look at me!

   C'mon, you guys
   should join us!
   It feels really good!

Leena:
   Unlike the rest of
   you, we're not here
   to play!
   Don't swim out
   too far, now!
 
 [Kid]
   Ooookay!
   Gotcha!

Leena:
   Kids sure have
   it easy...
   Remember when we
   were like that?
   Not a single care
   or worry on our minds...
   How each day lasted
   an eternity, filled
   with newness, fun
   and excitement...

Leena:
   But the important thing now
   is not our childhood but
   my Komodo-scale necklace!!!
   YES!
   We have to face up
   to reality and live
   each day anew!!!

Leena:
   So, I want you to go
   to Lizard Rock and
   get some scales for me!
   I would join you, but
   I still have to watch
   the kids...
   It's your fault you were late!
   Once you collect some
   Komodo dragon scales,
   I'll catch up with you
   at Opassa Beach.

Leena:
   Is that OK with you, Serge?
   ~~~Sure, no problem!
   ~~~Nah, forget it...

Leena:
   Good!
   That's what I
   wanted to hear!
   OK, then!
   Don't just stand around!
   Go collect some scales
   at Lizard Rock.
   Let's see...
   I think 3 should be enough.
   Good luck, Serge!
   I'm counting on you!

Leena:
   EXCUSE ME!?
   What did you just say?
   Hm? Serge!?
   Think about it!
   It's your fault for
   sleeping in, you know!
   Seeing as how you let
   me down, I'd say you
   owe me a couple hundred
   of those scales!
   Now go! Go to Lizard
   Rock and get some
   scales for me!
   I'll let you off easy this
   time with only 3 scales.
   I'm counting on you, Serge.
   Good luck, OK?

Leena:
   Once you get the
   scales, wait for me
   at Opassa Beach.
   It's just a bit south
   of Lizard Rock.
   I'll come by as soon as
   I'm done baby-sitting!

Leena:
   Come on, Serge!
   Get your butt over to
   Lizard Rock, already.
   I think I really deserve
   about a hundred scales, but
   I guess 3 will do for now.
   Once you get all 3 scales,
   wait for me at Opassa Beach.
   You know, it's south of
   Lizard Rock.
   And...I'll only accept scales
   that YOU personally collect.
   I don't want any that were
   just handed to you.
   
Leena:
   ......?

Leena:
   H-Hey...!
   Is that a Komodo dragon scale!?
   Where'd you get it?
   Someone gave it to you?
   No, no, that won't do.
   I don't want it if someone
   just handed it to you.
   You need to go out
   and get them on your
   own, OK, Serge?
   No cheating now!
   
Leena:
   Oh? What is it?
   ...[Item]?
   Nah-uh, Serge.
   That [Item] doesn't
   interest me one bit!
   Oh...
   Don't tell me
   you forgot about
   the promise you made.
   
Leena:
   Oh? What is it?
   ...[Item]?
   So...?

Leena:
   Oh? What is it?
   ...[Item]?
   Nah-uh, Serge.
   That [Item] doesn't
   interest me one bit!
   You promised to get me
   some Komodo dragon scales,
   remember!?

Leena:
   H-Hey......!
   Is that a Komodo dragon scale!?
   Where'd you get it?
   Ohh, someone gave it to you?
   Nah-uh, it's just not the same
   if YOU don't get it yourself.

 [Man]
   Huh? Oh yeah...
   I'm sorry, Poshul.
   I didn't even notice you.
   Anyway, Poshul won't be of

   head on back to the village.

 [Leena]
   There you are!

Leena:
   Sorry I'm late.
   I hope you didn't
   wait too long, Serge.
   Poshul? I didn't
   expect to see you here.
   So this is where you
   went off to.
   
Poshul:
   Weee!
   Leena'th here!
   How are you doing!?
   Ohhh!!! Are you two
   on a date?
   Sowwy, Me think Me should

   Oh, pulease!
   Don't be silly.

Poshul:
   PO-SHU-SHU...!

Leena:
   Sorry I'm late.
   I hope you didn't
   wait too long, Serge.
   
Leena:
   It sure has been a long time
   since we last came here...
   We used to come all the time.

Leena:
   Well? How'd it go?
   Did you get the
   Komodo dragon scales?

Leena:
   Oh, they're beautiful!
   I'll be able to make a
   great necklace with these.

Leena:
   Thank you,
   Serge!

Leena:
   And you, too,
   Poshul!

   AHEM!
   No probrem!

Leena:
   Thank you,

Leena:
   The sea never changes,
   does it...?
   It's been rolling in and out,
   like this, since long before
   we were born.
   It's been here for eternity,
   it seems...
   It's probably seen many things...
   Heard many things...
   It'll probably keep rolling
   in and out, in and out,
   long after our lifetime...
   Without a single change...

Leena:
   Hey, Serge...
   Remember we used to
   sit and talk like this
   when we were kids?
   With the gentle sea
   breeze and the tranquil
   sound of the waves?
   Just the two of us...
   Talking...

Leena:
   Do you still remember that day?
   ~~~I don't remember
   ~~~I remember 

Leena:
   Oh...
   Then I guess you forgot
   about the promise we made...
   Well, I guess it
   can't be helped.
   We were so young...
   On top of that, you almost
   drowned back then.
   It was a traumatic time for you.

Leena:
   Really!?
   You do...?
   So, Serge, you
   haven't forgotten
   about the promise
   we made that day!?

Leena:
   Hehee......
   That makes me...
   happy.

Leena:
   But aren't
   memories strange?
   Just when you think that
   you've forgotten about
   something, it comes floating
   back into your heart.
   I guess it's just lying
   there in wait.
   Waiting for that right
   moment...

Leena:
   Why, we might even
   remember this very
   moment someday!
   In 10, 20 years...when we're
   all grown up and married,
   and have kids of our own...
   Then one day...
   When that time comes,
   I wonder what kind of
   adults we'll be?
   What kind of life
   will I be leading...?

 [Leena]
   I wonder what to make of this day...?
   ~~~We'll forget it eventually
   ~~~We'll never forget this day!
   
Leena:
   Yeah......
   I guess so......
   But......
   That would be
   really sad...
   wouldn't it?

Leena:
   Yeah...
   I hope you're right.
   
Leena:
   Um, Serge...
   There's been something
   I've been wanting to...

 [Kid, across the dimensions]

   to sleep out here.
   
   You alright, boy?
   What on earth are you

   For a second there,
   I thought you might
   have been a dead body,
   washed ashore.

   Huh? Where's Leena...?
   You were the only one
   I saw when I got here.
   Are you a friend of
   Leena's?
   I believe she's in the
   village, babysitting.

   Well, I'd best be on my way.
   Anyway, if you're looking for Leena,
   you should stop by the village.
   You know, you shouldn't
   be playing out here, boy.
   Wouldn't want anything to
   happen to you, now.

Poshul:
   Serge!
   You're finally up!
   Thomething went
   '"whoosh,"' and
   Me wath out cold, too.

Poshul:
   Me woke up firtht,
   tho Me went to go
   rook around.
   But no thign of
   Leena anywhere.
   Do you think Leena
   thpontaneouthry combuthted?
   Me wonder if she'th OK?

   Go play outside.

Poshul:

   houthe, ithn't it?

 [Young Man]

   I've lived in this
   house for 5 years now.
   Sorry, that name
   doesn't ring a bell.

Poshul:

Poshul:

   Yeah?
   So what's your point?
   Just get outta
   my house, will ya?
   
 [Pier, Arni (Another)]
 
Poshul:
   Leena! Tho thith
   ith where you were!
   How could you jutht
   reave uth and go back
   on your own!?

Leena:
   ......

   On my own?
   What are you talking
   about, Poshul?030
   And...

Leena:
   Who are you?
   Have we met somewhere
   before...?
   Are you from Termina?

Poshul:
   PO-SHU?
   What are you
   thaying, Leena?
 
 [Boy]
   HEEEY!
   Yeah, YOU!

   Don't be tryin' to
   pull any moves on
   our Leena, you jerk!

Leena:
   Don't be silly!
   Don't go swimming out
   too far now, you hear!?

 [Boy]
   Ooookay!
   Gotcha!

Leena:
   Kids...
   I guess kids
   will be kids...

Leena:
   Don't worry
   about them.

Leena:
   Hmmm...
   You know...
   You look a lot like
   the boy who used to
   live next door to me...

   ~~~What was his name...?
   ~~~What happened to him?

Leena:
   Why...?
   Why do you want
   to know his name?

Leena:
   What happened
   to him...?
   Why do you want to know?
   It's really none of
   your business.

Leena:
   That boy...
   died......
   He drowned...
   when he was very young...
   This all happened 10 years ago.

Leena:
   Soon after, his
   mother passed
   away, too...
   I was still very young
   back then, so I don't
   remember too well, but
   my mom says his name was...

Leena:
   ...Serge...

   ~~~I'm Serge!!!
   ~~~That's nonsense!!!
   
Leena:
   ......!?
   You're Serge!?
   Oh, stop that!
   That's not even funny!!!
   The boy is dead, don't you
   understand!?

Leena:
   Why would I lie
   about something
   like that!?
   Do you think I'm so
   cruel as to make
   something like that up!?

Leena:
   That boy...
   I guess I kinda liked him...
   If that boy were still
   alive today, I wonder
   what would've become of us?

Leena:
   Sure is weird...
   Why am I opening up
   to you like this?
   Well, I guess there's
   no use thinking about
   the past.
   It's not like Serge is
   going to come back...
   Mom always tells me
   I shouldn't dwell on
   a lost loved one...

Leena:
   ......
   You can find his
   grave up on Cape Howl.
   Actually, why don't you go
   visit the grave site?
   No one's been up
   there in a while...
   Well, I still have
   some chores to finish.
   Sorry I blew up
   at you like that.

Leena:
   Good-bye...
   stranger.

Leena:
   You'll find the
   boy's grave up
   on Cape Howl...
   It'd be great if
   you could visit it.030
   I'm sure Serge
   would be happy, too...

Leena:
   Is that...
   a Komodo dragon scale!?
   EeeeeeeK!
   That's disgusting!
   Get that away from me!

Leena:
   Hmm? What is it?
   A [Item]?
   Nope.
   A [Item] won't
   win my heart.

 [Karsh]
   So you must be Serge...
   The ghost of the boy
   who died 10 years ago.
   
   Sorry, junior, but we have no
   business with your friends.
   We're just after you...
   Be a good boy and come with us.
   
 [Solt/Peppor]
   But, Sir Karsh...
   Do you think it is truly true
   that this chap is a ghost?
   He seems like a perfectly
   perfect young boy to me...

Karsh:
   That doesn't matter!
   We found the boy here,
   just as '"he"' said we
   would, didn't we?

Karsh:
   Now seize him!
   
 [Kid]
   Hold yer sea horses!!!
   
Karsh:
   Who the...?
   
Karsh:
   Outta the way, missy!
   You don't wanna get
   hurt, now, do you?
   
 [Kid]
   Shut yer trap!
   You're the ones who'd
   betta get outta the way.
   
Dragoon:
   ...You have a problem!?
   Do you have a shakin' idea
   who you're dealing with, missy?
   
Karsh:
   That's enough!!!
   
Karsh:
   Listen up, junior!
   Our orders are to
   take you in.

Karsh:
   We don't wanna hurt you.
   Just come with us.

Karsh:
   Or else...
   this axe o' mine will
   have to do the talkin'.

Girl:
   For cryin' out loud...
   Would ya just shut up
   and get on with it...!
   I'm gonna kick yer
   sorry arses so hard
   you'll kiss the moons!

Karsh:
   Fair enough...
   You leave us no choice.
   You'll regret this, missy!
   
 [Battle]
 
Solt:
   Sir! His innately INNATE
   Element color attribute is...
   ~~~~WHITE!~~~~

Karsh:
   Right! 
   That does it...!
   Quick, attack him with
   the opposite Element
   attribute color...
   ~~~~BLACK!~~~~

Solt:
   How unfortunately unfortunate!
   I do not seem to have any, Sir!

Karsh:
   You nincompoop!
   You should always carry
   Elements of every color!
   Then how about you
   there...?

Peppor:
   I'm shakin' in my shoes
   to tell you this, Sir, but
   I don't have any either!
   We'll have to let you,
   Sir Karsh, show us how
   it's done...

Karsh:
   !?
   Useless fools!
   Errh......
   Real men don't need
   magic when they can
   fight with their might!
   
 [Cape Howl (Another)]

 [Solt]
   ...It's no use.
   There's no escape that way.
   All you have to do
   is come with us.

 [Peppor]
   Don't move!!!
   
Karsh:
   I wouldn't resist if I were you.
   Take a look behind you...
   There's nowhere to run!

Girl:
   Oi! ...The hell you doin'!?
   These blokes are tryin'
   to make off with ya!

Girl:
   Are you just gonna
   do as you're told!?
   What are you thinkin'!?
   Get with the program,
   mate!
   ~~~Hold on a second
   ~~~Alright, I'll fight
   
Karsh:
   Maybe my axe will beat
   some sense into you!

Girl:
   Yeah, yeah...
   You're just all talk!
   Now, C'MON!

Peppor:
   S-Sir Karsh!
   I say we shake it on outta
   here, so that we can live
   to fight another day!
   Th-These aren't no
   ordinary brats we're
   dealing with...!

Karsh:
   Damn cowards!

Karsh:
   As for you, missy...!
   We won't forget this!

Girl:
   Oooh, I'm sooo scaaared!
   I'll be happy to take
   you on, anytime!
   Think I'll lose to scum
   like you!? Hah!

Girl:
   You alright, mate?

Girl:
   Serge...
   Your name's Serge,
   ain't it?

Girl:
   ......

Girl:
   Oh, me?
   My name's...

Kid:
   Call me '"Kid."'
   Nice to meet ya.

Kid:
   I just couldn't stand by
   and watch those blokes
   gang up on you like that.
   They just pissed the
   bloody hell outta me.
   I wish I could've beat
   'em up some more!

Kid:
   But why was that
   mob after ya?

Kid:
   Whaddaya mean you've never
   even met 'em before? Eh?
   Ahhh, forget it.

Kid:
   Hey, Serge....!
   How about you and me
   team up for a while?
   That Karsh fella ain't
   gonna just leave you alone,
   that's for sure!

Kid:
   And to tell ya the truth,
   I'm new to these islands...
   It's pretty lonely travelin'
   around here on me own.
   Hehehe...

Kid:
   So, how 'bout it,
   Serge?
   Perhaps it was fate
   that we would meet
   up like this!

   ~~~Travel together
   ~~~Refuse...

Kid:
   Beauty, mate!
   That decides it then!
   We're real good mates now!

Kid:
   Anyways, it'll be
   gettin' dark soon.
   I suggest we head to
   Arni and shack up
   for the night!

Kid:
   Oh, and Serge.
   Don't go tryin' any
   funny stuff just
   coz I'm cute 'n all!

Kid:
   Hang on!

Kid:
   Are you tellin' me, you're gonna
   refuse the company of a lonely,
   vulnerable, sweet little girl?

   ~~~Fine, let's go
   ~~~......

Kid:
   You sure there, mate?
   You might live to regret it,
   ya know!?

   ~~~Sure, let's go
   ~~~No, thanks

Kid:
   Sheeze!
   Well, have it
   your way, mate!

Kid:
   Beauty, mate!
   That decides it then!
   We're real good mates now!

Kid:
   Anyways, it'll be
   gettin' dark soon.
   I suggest we head to
   Arni and shack up
   for the night!

Kid:
   And don't go tryin' any
   funny stuff just
   coz I'm cute 'n all!

Kid:
   Beauty, mate!
   That decides it, then!
   We're real good mates now!

Kid:
   Anyways, it'll be
   gettin' dark soon.
   I suggest we head to
   Arni and shack up
   for the night!

Kid:
   And don't go tryin' any
   funny stuff just
   coz I'm cute 'n all!
   
Kid:
   I'll be headin' up north
   to a town called Termina.

Kid:
   It'll be gettin'
   dark pretty soon.
   I suggest ya go find
   a place to shack up
   for the night.
   Don't want ya to become
   Heckran bait, now.
   Hehehe...

Kid:
   Well...
   See ya!

Kid:
   What!? You died
   10 years ago?
   
Kid:
   Whatever, mate.
   Look at you. You're
   as fit as a fiddle!
   
Kid:
   So what exactly happened
   to ya 10 years ago?
   You don't remember?

   ~~~No, I don't
   ~~~Yes, I do
   
Kid:
   Yeah, I didn't think so.
   You were just a li'l squirt
   10 years ago.
   Of course you don't remember.
   Oh, well...
   No worries, mate.
   It's perfectly normal.

Kid:
   Cheer up, eh?
   We'll find out what's
   goin' on soon enough.

Kid:
   No worries, mate.

Kid:
   You remember!?
   You do!?
   But you were just a li'l
   squirt 10 years ago.
   How can ya remember
   that far back?
   
Kid:
   What...?
   Ya had a strange dream?
   You say ya might end up
   hurtin' me!?
   
Kid:
   Git off it!
   Don't make me laugh!
   She'll be right, mate.
   I don't go down that

Leena:
   Rise and shine, everyone!
   A new day awaits!

Leena:
   I'm glad I found
   you here, though.
   Serge, right...?
   Kinda feels odd
   calling you that...

Leena:
   You know...
   I've been thinking...
   Maybe you had some kind of
   accident and hit your head.
   That's why your memory's
   all messed up.
   You're really someone else,
   but you think you're the
   Serge who died 10 years ago.

Leena:
   I want to help you.
   I can't just leave
   you alone like this.
   And...
   You don't seem like
   such a bad person, either...
   You're planning to go
   to Termina, right?
   Then let me join you.
   I have some errands
   to run over there, anyway.

Leena:
   And to tell you
   the truth...
   It feels like I've
   always known you...
   Sounds strange,
   doesn't it?

Leena:
   Well, that's that!
   Shall we get going?
   
Leena:
   OK!
   Let's head to

   Yeah, I know.
   You and I are

   I don't know how I
   ended up like this...
   I don't have a body and
   I don't remember a thing!
   You understand what I'm
   goin' thru, don't ya?
   But I have a feelin'
   everything will come
   back to me once I
   find my body parts.
   So, how 'bout it?
   Will ya help me find my body?
   ~~~Sure
   ~~~Not my thing...

   Nyak-nyak-nyak!!!
   Yeah!?
   I'm heavier than I look,
   but I hope ya don't mind!
   And don't swing me

   a talkin' skull, eh?
   Well, have it your way.
   Sorry, I frightened ya.
   It's about time I left
   these parts, anyway.
   See ya...
   
Peppor:
   Shake it!
   W-We can't just shake it on
   back to the manor like this...
   We failed in our mission!
   
Solt:
   That was awfully awful,
   back there, Peppor.
   I want a rematch!

Peppor:
   B-By the way...
   Do you remember
   what kinda outfit
   he was shakin'?

Solt:
   Hmmm...

Solt:
   Just something justly
   like that, Peppor!

Peppor:
   O-Oh, you remember.
   So he looked like that, huh?

Solt:
   Actually, it is him, Peppor!

Peppor:
   S-So you're sure about that?

Solt:
   Wonderfully
   wonderful timing, Peppor!

Peppor:
   L-Let's shake it!
   W-We're really gonna
   shake it to you
   this time!!!
   
Solt:
   Come at us with all
   your mightily might!
   
Peppor:
   W-We're really gonna
   shake it to you
   this time!!!
   
Solt:
   Are they seriously serious
   about escaping?
   
Peppor:
   W-We win!
   Solt, how about
   a handshake?
   
Solt:
   But they're still
   there, Peppor!
   
Peppor:
   Then, let's shake
   a leg!

 [Battle]
   
Solt:
   This time I made sure
   to bring a BLACK Element
   with me, Peppor!

Peppor:
   Good work...
   Well, shake it on up
   and attack him with it!

Solt:
   Affirmatively affirmative,
   Peppor...

Solt:
   Oh deary dear!
   ......?

Peppor:
   That was no BLACK ATTACK
   Element you used just now,
   was it!?
   It was a Black Element that
   makes your foe MORE SUSCEPTIBLE
   TO attacks of the opposite
   color attribute, WHITE, wasn't it!?

Solt:
   I'm afraid you're right...
   How terribly terrible!

Peppor:
   You DID bring a WHITE
   ATTACK Element with you,
   didn't you!?
   If you didn't bring one
   with you, you're more
   stupid than I thought!

Solt:
   Errh......
   How awfully awful!
   I'm afraid I didn't,
   Peppor...!
   
Solt:
   Retreat!!!

Peppor:
   L-Let's shake it on
   outta here!

 [Woman]
   Sorry, I'm totally
   out of bellflowers.
   There's a big ruckus
   down in Fossil Valley.
   Men from the dragoons
   were setting road
   blocks in the valley.
   I'll get some in a
   few days, so come
   back again then.

Young man:
   ......
   You have my sincerest apologies.
   I understand we are here
   to protect you as Acacia
   Dragoons...
   Those knights should be done
   with their work shortly.

 [Woman]
   Oh, that's alright.
   I can get my flowers
   from other places, too.
   Never mind that,
   I haven't seen Karsh
   around here lately.
   How is he doing?

Young man:
   Well...
   He said he was going ghost-
   hunting down south.
   I'm just a private, so I do
   not know for certain, but I
   heard a rumor that Lord
   Viper ordered him to go.

 [Woman]
   A ghost!?
   Now that is something...
   I just hope it's not a
   sign of a coming disaster.
   If you ever see him,
   give him my regards.

Young man:
   I will do that.
   And I will be back, too.
   
Kid:
   Oi, did ya hear that?
   Karsh is that bastard
   we saw at the cape!?
   And that ghost he's
   huntin'...
   Ain't that you, mate?
   So, that Acacia Dragoon
   mob is behind this after
   all...
   Let's check this place
   out a bit more!
   
Kid:
   Gawd, you're slow!?
   Ya made me wait forever.
   Makin' a lovely lady like......!?

Kid:
   Ahaa......
   So that's it.

Kid:
   You're walkin' a dog when
   ya don't even know who
   the hell you are?

Kid:
   I get it!
   This sheila over here
   is yer sweetie, eh?
   I'm right, ain't I?
   No need to be shy!
   I'm not so bold as to break
   up lovers' tender moments.
   I'm understandin'...
   I'll wait until yer little
   date's over.

Kid:
   Boy, you amaze me.
   Oh well, I guess it ain't
   such a bad idea to walk
   around and clear up ya
   mind a bit.

Kid:
   But geez,
   to go straight to the
   inn with a young girl...
   You're pretty slick
   for such an innocent
   lookin' boy!

   Well then,
   have a bloody good time...!!!
   
   Alright,
   all squeaky clean.
   It's got to be
   extra clean for the
   coming festivities.

 [Old Man]
   Master Viper...
   I'm here to polish your
   statue again!!!

   Have you folks come to
   see the Viper Festival?
   Termina is peaceful thanks
   to the watchful eye of our
   Master Viper.
   At times warm,
   at times strict,
   Master Viper watches over
   us always.

   With that said, of course
   the real Master Viper
   resides in his manor, along
   with his Acacia Dragoons.

   If you'll allow me to brag
   a little bit, I was invited
   to the manor a while back.
   It is a magnificent place...
   If there is a heaven on earth
   that would be it...
   The manor is beautiful and its
   design incorporates the surrounding
   terrain to its advantage, making
   it an impenetrable fortress.
   On top of that, there are powerful
   soldiers standing guard in front of
   the main gates that can destroy
   any monster with just one blow!

   Well, an upright citizen
   like myself might be invited
   to the manor's garden party,
   but not so for you folks.
   The most you will get is a
   cold reception from the gate
   guards. Ho ho ho!

Kid:
   Alright, that's settled!
   We've gotta sneak into
   Viper Manor.
   You gotta find out what
   those Acacia Dragoons are
   up to, right?
   Why was Karsh tryin'
   to capture ya?
   I've got some business
   there as well, so I'll
   go with ya.
   How 'bout it, Serge?
   ~~~OK, let's go!
   ~~~No, I won't go

Kid:
   It's the obvious
   choice, right?
   According to grandpa here,
   this Viper Manor's a bloody
   large place, which also means
   it'll be easy to break into!
   There's gotta be more
   than one way in.
   If we don't plan this right,
   it'll cost us our lives.

Kid:
   What're ya afraid of?
   Don't give me that rubbish.
   You're a man, aren't ya?
   Don't ya wanna know what
   happened ten years ago,
   and what the hell's goin'
   on right now?
   Your only clues are that
   Acacia Dragoon mob and their
   leader, that Viper bloke.
   Any investigation into the 
   Dragoons has gotta start with
   checkin' out Viper's manor.

   ......

Kid:
   Ha, so that's how you're
   gonna be, eh?
   You're gonna live the rest
   of yer life in the shadows
   as a dead man's ghost.
   Is that right?

Kid:
   You'll regret it!!!
   I'm partin' ways with ya
   here.
   But, 'cause I pity ya,
   I'll give ya this just in case.
   It's a Tele-Porter.
   This is a really handy gadget
   that allows ya to exchange
   party members from afar.
   The way ya use it is...
   Ah, forget it.
   Check it out for yerself.
   I hate explainin' the details.

Kid:
   Don't ya ever show that
   face of yers again, ya mug!
   See ya!!!

Kid:
   Oh yeah, Serge.
   I'll leave this in yer

 [Strange Woman]
   Hello there! Come and
   see for yourself!
   This is the prize of all prizes,
   a rare catch, a live mermaid!
   This is what you call a
   real treasure.
   Remember that, kids.
   Unfortunately,
   this one isn't for sale.
   She's my most valuable item.
   
   So, what do you think?
   This isn't some stuffed
   animal or anything.
   She's really alive.
   Her pure, clear skin, like it's
   made from crystal. Her gem-like
   eyes. She is the ultimate
   collector's item!
   Phew...
   Nature's creations are
   indeed great.
   Such a beautiful thing...
 
 [Boy]
   Is this thing really alive?
   Hey, come on!
   Look over this way!!!
   
 [Girl]
   Oh, how beautiful she is...

 [Kids]
   Yeow!!!

   Ouch!!!
   
Korcha:
   Hey, you!
   You think this is really
   fun?
   How wouldCHA feel if you
   were trapped in a tank
   like that, being stared
   at everyday, huh?

 [Kids]
   Yikes, it's Korcha!!!
   Run!!!

 [Strange Woman]
   Korcha, not you again!?
   Don't you go bothering
   my customers.
   This is no place for the
   likes of you!
   Just leave now!!!

Korcha:
   CHA! Shut up!
   What customers!?
   You're sellin' a
   bunch of bull!
   Why didn'tCHA
   keep the tank
   uncovered when
   I showed up?

Korcha:
   Heeey everybody!!!
   This shop is a bunch of
   boloney!!!

 [Strange Woman]
   Sh-Shut your mouth!
   Don't you say such
   ridiculous things!!!
   Get back to your demi-human
   friends!

Korcha:
   Heh, I won't take that from
   a sleaze-bag like you!

Korcha:
   Hey, you guys.
   You're not from around
   here, eh?
   Don'tCHA wander around
   too much, or you're gonna
   get burned.
   Just watch your back.

 [Strange Woman]
   That's Korcha!
   He's from Guldove.
   I wonder why he hangs
   around here in Termina
   all the time?
   You shouldn't mess
   with the likes of him!
   I tell you...he's
   nothing but trouble!

Poshul:
   PO-SHU!

Leena:
   Hey, Poshul!!!
   Stop that!

Poshul:
   PO-SHU-SHU...!
   You've rucked out
   for today!!!

 [The Dragon's Tail, Termina (Another)]
 
Guile:
   My name is Guile.
   I am having a certain bet
   with the fortune-teller by
   the bridge.
   If I can bring the item of
   proof from the manor
   within a week, I shall win.
   If I cannot, I shall lose,
   but...

Guile:
   As there is a trick behind
   any mysterious magic...
   there is no such thing as an
   impregnable fortress in this
   world. A toast to my
   coming victory...!
   
Guile:
   Hmm, so you have business
   at the manor as well...
   Interesting!
   Gambling is a lot more
   interesting with higher
   stakes...
   What we need now is a
   seasoned sailor and
   a sturdy boat to cross
   the rough waters.
   If you can find one,
   leave the rest to me.
   I will guide you to
   Viper Manor.
   What will it be?
   
Guile:
   Once you find a boat,
   leave the rest to me.
   I shall guide you.
   I believe the fortune-teller
   said the target for the bet
   is located in the manor's
   mess hall...
   
Guile:
   There is no such thing as an
   impregnable fortress in this
   world.
   It is destined to be so...

Guile:
   What we need now is a
   seasoned sailor and
   a sturdy boat.
   If you can find one,
   leave the rest to me.
   I will guide you to
   Viper Manor.
   
Guile:
   I am but a free
   wanderer...
   Call me if you
   change your mind.
 
 [Termina (Another)]
 
 [Fortune Teller]
   Grin...
   Sir Guile, how was it?
   Did you find the item?

   Guile:
   Ma'am, do not rush me so.
   The deadline is not yet upon us.
   I will be going now.

   Ho ho ho, words!
   My victory is only a
   matter of time!
   The item in question is in
   the dining room of the manor.
   Although, you'll never reach it!
   
   Well this is interesting.
   You're not dead or
   anything are you?
   Has anybody called you back
   from the great beyond?
   You just might be the key
   to the destruction of this
   entire planet.
   I can't say for sure, but
   fate seems to have a great
   task for you. 
   Be careful now, boy!
   
Kid:
   Hey, Serge,
   that's nothin' but rubbish.
   Let's hurry up and get movin'.
   
 [Fortune Teller]
   Hmm... You there!
   
   In your eyes, I perceive...
   both the look of a beauty 
   and the look of a beast.
   Be mindful not to bring
   about your own end, my
   dear.
   A dream lies in wait,
   reaching out to
   engulf you.
   
Kid:
   Sorry, mum.
   I don't believe in
   fortune-tellin' at all.
   I make way for me own
   future by meself.

 [Fortune Teller]
   Lassie, you should listen
   to your elder's advice.

Kid:
   Ha, I don't give a damn.
   Let's go Serge.

 [Shrine Area, Termina (Another)]
 
Young lady:
   So, she was out of
   flowers...
   That is unfortunate.
   Then let us pray
   without any flowers
   for today.

Young man:
   Hmm...?

Young man:
   Is that a bellflower
   you have there?
   Would you be so kind as to
   give up that flower to us?
   We need a bellflower for
   our prayer.

Young man:
   For free?
   Are you sure?
   I thank you deeply.

Young man:
   How much would you like for it?
   ~~~[Amount]

Young man:
   That is quite high.
   But...I agree.
   Here, please check the amount.

Young man:
   You must be a very kind person
   to part with this flower for
   so little.
   I will always remember your
   kindness.

   [Member] received
   [Amount] G from the young man!

Young man:
   Is there no way you will
   part with it? We would
   really like to have it...

Young lady:
   Stop.
   These people are also
   in need of the flower.
   Dear sirs, please pardon
   us for the interruption.
   We are very sorry.
   Now, let us pray.
   Without the flowers,
   all we need is our hearts.

Young lady:
   Dario, here is a bellflower
   that you used to love so much.
   Soon, the flower's seeds shall
   sprout, grow leaves,  and
   bloom flowers everywhere.
   And we shall age another year,
   while you will remain the same,
   in memory...

Young man:
   Father...
   Brother......

Young lady:
   It is such a mystery:
   this sword never rusts,
   even when left in the rain...
   It seems as if the souls of
   its masters live within it.

Young lady:
   Do you not think so,
   Glenn?

Glenn:
   Yes...
   I have engraved in my memory
   the lives of my father and
   brother, who had wielded the
   sacred sword Einlanzer.

Young lady:
   Let us hope that is true...

Glenn:
   What do you mean by that?
   Miss Riddel, I cannot
   allow even you to...

Riddel:
   Do you not think there is
   something odd about the
   dragoons of late...?
   Daddy's face shows such
   anguish, and even Karsh
   was saying he was sent
   on a '"ghost-hunt"'...

 [Glenn]
   Miss Riddel...

Riddel:
   Everyone has been acting oddly,
   ever since that beastly
   guest arrived at the manor.

 [Glenn]
   ......

Riddel:
   Glenn, promise me
   to always keep the
   unclouded truth in sight.
   Do not be swayed by the
   masses.
   The splendor of the Einlanzer
   must not be tarnished...

 [Glenn]
   ...As you wish.

 [Riddel]
   Chuckle...
   
 [Glenn]
   ...?

Riddel:
   Oh, forgive me.
   I just found it a little
   awkward to hear you
   say such words...
   Chuckle...

Glenn:
   ......
   Miss Riddel,
   a chill wind has risen.
   Shall we return
   to the manor?

Riddel:
   Yes...
   Of course.

Young lady:
   Please, let me offer you my
   gratitude as well.
   The souls that rest beneath this
   sword loved this flower in life.
   That is why we always bring
   some here when we pray here...
 
Korcha:
   ...and that guy
   rushed and hid it as
   soon as I got there.
   It was a hilarious sight!

 [Demi-human]
   Hya hya hya,
   that's great!

Korcha:
   Oops, I've got customers.
   Sorry,
   I'll getCHA some BIG
   fish next time you come by.

 [Demi-human]
   Alright, Korcha.
   But is it really gonna
   be big this time?
   You only ever catch small fry.
   Your boating skills are
   first class, but your fishing
   skills suck...

Korcha:
   Aw, shawdup!
   
 [Demi-human]
   See ya.

Korcha:
   Oh it's you guys.
   You're tourists, right?
   The festival's a waste of time.
   My name's Korcha.
   I'm here from Guldove,
   workin' as a ferryman.
   I can take you anywhere
   you like with this boat.
   I take money, but don't
   worry, it's not that much.
   My boatin' skills are quite
   famous around here, I
   guarantee a comfortable ride.
   
Kid:
   We've got business to take
   care of, so there's no time
   for a pleasure cruise.
   See ya!

Member:
   We're a little busy,
   so maybe next time.

Korcha:
   Alright.
   If you ever want to get
   somewhere by boat, swing by.

Kid:
   Hey, you.
   We want to get to Viper Manor.
   Can ya take us there?

Korcha:
   Viper Manor?
   WhatCHA gonna do up in
   that place?
   Ya gonna go steal treasure
   from the vaults or somethin'?

Kid:
   Don't go snooping into
   yer customers' privacy.
   Are ya gonna take us there
   or what?

 [Member]:
   Then how about
   Viper Manor?

Korcha:
   As long as you can pay me,
   I'll take you anywhere you
   want.
   It's just that I don't know
   how to get to the manor.
   If you want to get there,
   bring someone who does.
   
Korcha:
   Back again, eh?
   I'll take you wherever
   you want.
   
Korcha:
   WhatCHA gonna do?
   ~~~To Viper Manor
   ~~~No, wait a minute
   
Guile:
   I shall guide you there.

Korcha:
   Are ya sure you can get
   into a place like that?

Guile:
   Yes, trust me.
   All you need to do
   is prepare the boat.
   
Korcha:
   You got it.
   But, it'll cost ya!
   It's gonna be 100G.
   ~~~Pay it
   ~~~Don't pay
   
Korcha:
   Hey, you ain't goin'
   nowhere without
   enough money!

Korcha:
   !?
   What, don'tCHA
   wanna go?
   
Korcha:
   Come on, get on board.
   It's a little tight
   with four of us, but it'll
   be a short trip.
   Don'tCHA worry about a thing.
 
 [Strange Woman]
   Hey!
   Those guys didn't
   listen to me!
   Geez...
   
 [Viper Manor Bluffs (Another)]
 
Korcha:
   Don'tCHA think it's
   pretty dangerous!?

Guile:
   Indeed...

Guile:
   We'll make it...

Kid:
   You sound confident...

Kid:
   Alright, let's get
   our arses in gear.
   
Member:
   ......

Member:
   Serge, 
   let's go.
   
Korcha:
   What?
   You wanna head back?

Korcha:
   Well, hop on then.

Korcha:
   Headin' back already!?
   You just got here.

   Oi, Serge.
   We're inside

Kid:

   'til nightfall.
   
Member:
   Serge, we made
   it inside the premises.
   Let's wait here
   until nightfall.
 
 [Magical Dreamers Ship, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Roadie]
   This is my first time
   visiting Termina, so I
   was wandering around town
   promoting the band.
   Lively town, food's great,
   all in all, a pretty nice
   place.
   The concert's success seems
   almost guaranteed, but...
   Just between us,
   the main star, Nikki,
   is missing...
   Have you seen him around?
   We've found him in a daze
   quite a few times lately...
   It's like he was here in
   body, but not in spirit.
   But, man, without him, we're
   pretty stuck. We can't even
   start rehearsing for the show.
   Miki's supposed to be back
   soon from searching, but...

   Miki!
   How was it,
   did you find him?

Miki:
   No, it's no use!!!
   I was able to track him
   up 'til he went into
   Shadow Forest, but...
   There were knights guarding
   the entrance of the forest,
   and I couldn't get in.
   Besides, I really didn't
   want to be in that creepy
   forest on my own.
   There's supposedly a way
   into Viper Manor at the end
   of the forest, but what is
   that idiot tryin' to do!?
   
 [Roadie]
   I see...
   So he definitely went
   into Shadow Forest...

Miki:
   Hey, I know!
   You guys can help me out!
   I'll lure the knights away
   from the entrance, then
   you can go into the forest
   and find Nikki!
   Pretty please? Won't you help
   out a pretty girl in distress?
   ~~~OK, rock on!
   ~~~Wait just a minute...

Miki:
   Really?
   Oh, you're a lifesaver!
   OK, let's start moving!

Miki:
   Oh, that's too bad...
   But if you change your mind,
   please let me know!
   Now, what should we do...
   
Miki:
   Really?
   Oh, you're a lifesaver!
   OK, let's start moving!

Miki:
   Oh, that's too bad...
   But if you change your mind,
   please let me know!

   We carry only the best goods!
   Come and take a look.

   Do ye have any '"iron"'
   with ye? We've been out of
   it for the longest time...
   We could make stonger items
   if only we had iron...

   If ye need something, come
   talk to me at the counter.
   It disnae look professional
   if we talk back here, right?
   Oh, and please don't talk to
   mah hubby back there.
   He'll throw a fit if ye do.

Zappa:
   ......

Zappa:
   Arrch! How many times do ah
   have to say it, dinnae let
   the customers back in here!
   How many years have ye
   been me wife!?

Zippa, Zappa's wife:
   What's a big ape like ye doin',
   worryin' about such trivial
   stuff!?
   Don't ye be complainin' up
   a storm over just one or two
   customers coming to talk
   to ye!!!

Zappa:
   Arrch, ye'll never ken
   the delicate heart of a
   craftsman like yours truly.

Zappa:
   There not be just one
   or two, but three!
   Arrch, ye'll never ken
   the delicate heart of a
   craftsman like yours truly.

Zappa:
   Ah dinnae expect a layman like
   ye to ken what ah'm sayin',
   but...
   The art of smithin' may seem
   only like physical labor, but
   it requires far more mental
   prowess.
   Everytime the hammer strikes, a
   wee bit o' mah soul goes with it.
   Ah guess what ah'm sayin' is, thy
   soul is what makes the sword.
   So, that means yir yappin' is
   distractin' me, I cannae focus
   mah soul into the steel.
   D'ye ken? If so, then get going.

Zappa:
   Ah, why can ye no leave me be?
   This sword, it's no good now.
   Time to start over...
   
Zappa:
   Take yir business up
   to the counter, ken?
 
 [Zappa]
   Huh?

Zappa:
   That nail of yirs,
   it be a fine piece of work...
   Likesay it's the work of
   a skilled craftsman...
   Ay, there's no mistakin' it.
   
Mysterious Swordsman:
   Swordsmanship is as beautiful
   as a rose.
   The rouge ambition hidden
   beneath its beauty...
   Ahh, these words fit
   moi perfectly...

Mysterious Swordsman:
   Oh, pardon me monsieur.
   Moi forgot to introduce myself.
   Mon name is Pierre.
   I am renting this room from
   Monsieur Zappa.

Pierre:
   I am on my way to see
   this General Viper soon.
   From what I hear, there is a
   vacancy among the 4 Devas of
   the Acacia Dragoons.
   Such a position is perfect
   for such a splendid swordsman
   as moi...
   One graceful flash of mon sword
   will surely have them saluting
   moi as the guest of honor...

Pierre:
   But I have lost mon precious
   medal, symbol of heroism...
   Without it, I will certainly be
   turned away at the gate.
   Sacré bleu! What am I to do?
   
Pierre:
   I have lost mon precious
   medal of heroism...
   I am on my way to see this
   General Viper, but...
   Without it, I will certainly
   be turned away at the gate.
   Sacré bleu!
   What is a hero like moi to do?
 
 [Termina (Another)]
   
Mojo:
   B-Brother...?
   No., it's-om very similar,
   but it's-om not him...
   My long lost-om brother...
   Where are-om you now?

 [John]
   I just found something super!

   Tadaa!!!
   It's cool, ain't it?
   A shiny medal on my chest!
   It fits me perfectly!

[Member]:
   I know someone
   who's looking
   for that...

[Member]:
   I know
   someone who's
   looking for that...

 [John]
   Well...
   I'd be a thief if
   I didn't return lost
   items...
   And I want to be a hero,
   not a thief!
   OK, here you go!

 [John]
   No way!
   Let me have it
   just a little longer!
  
Pierre:
   ......
   Why must you show that
   to moi?
   I am trés busy.
   Leave me be. Merci!
   
Pierre:
   Oui, monsieur!
   That is my medal!
   Merci, merci, thank you!!!
   Ahh la lah, what a darling
   you are!
   
Pierre:
   Now I can finally head
   to Viper Manor!
   
Pierre:
   I insist you take moi when
   you call at the gates of
   Viper Manor.
   Alone, of course, moi would
   have no problems, but you
   could also be useful...
   After all, thorns like you
   are necessary to add charm
   to a rose...

Pierre:
   Now, come with moi!
   ~~~OK, let's go
   ~~~No, wait a minute
   
Pierre:
   Without mon charm and
   complexion, les guards
   will turn you away!
   
Pierre:
   Now, follow my lead
   to Viper Manor,
   mon faithful followers!
   
Zappa:
   Pierre...
   Ye still owe 
   me last month's rent...

Pierre:
   Non non, monsieur!
   You shouldn't be so hasty!
   I shall pay you double...
   once I make it to stardom!
   
Zippa:
   Mr. Pierre, when will
   ye pay us last month's
   rent?

Pierre:
   Non non, madame!
   You shouldn't be so hasty!
   I shall pay you double...
   once I make it to stardom!
   
 [Termina (Another)]
   
 [John]
   Huff, huff.
   I'm working hard to
   become a future hero!!!
   The first step to heroism
   is building a good physique!
   That's why I'm running laps
   around here!

Pierre:
   That a boy!
   But, the most important
   trait of a hero is beauty.
   Perfect your appearance
   in the mirror everyday!

 [John]
   Ah, really?
   Oh!
   So that's why my
   big sis is so strong!
   
 [Van's House, Termina (Another)]
 
Van:
   Bother! That is not it.
   Something is missing...
   I believe I am on the
   right track, however...

Van:
   ...What is your opinion?
   ~~~I think it's good
   ~~~...But is it art?

Van:
   You really think so?
   Why thank you, but I still need
   to hone my skills a little more.

Van:
   ......
   What would you know...

Van:
   Father...
   When did you come home?

Van's father, Gogh:
   Ah, I came back just
   a moment ago. The ship
   docked ahead of schedule.
   How have you been?
   After a short break,
   I shall be on my way again.

Van:
   Oh, father...
   Off on another business
   trip, again...?

Gogh:
   Yes, that's right.
   This is another important
   business opportunity.
   I shall be gone for
   a while again.
   Why don't you paint less
   and start studying
   accounting for a change?
   You'll never make a
   living off of painting.

Van:
   ......

Gogh:
   If there is anything you
   need, tell the maid.
   She shall give you some money.
   Well, I'm off.

Van:
   Father had promised to go see
   the festival with me...
   But then, he does not
   really care about the
   promises he makes with me!!!

Van:
   I do not believe father even
   notices the view here.
   The colors of the sea and
   sky far surpass the beauty of
   those gems he collects.
   I do wonder if he really was
   a painter in his youth...
   It is rather hard to believe.
 
 [Termina (Another)]
 
 [Portrait Artist]
   Huh? You've met the
   nouveau-rich over there?
   He's stuck up now,
   but he and I used
   to study art together.
   He was the best of us all...
   But, ever since his beloved
   wife died, he's all about
   money, money, money...
   He's completely changed.
   It's a pity that he's used
   his skills to make money out
   of counterfeit paintings...
   
 [Portrait Artist]
   So this is Nikki...
   My nice, steady girlfriend,
   Rachel, has stopped playing
   house with me ever since
   she heard he was coming...
   Is he that attractive...?

   Racheeelll!
   Come baaack!!!

   Sob...
   Hurry up and go home, Nikki!!!

Nikki:

 [Skelly's House, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Grandma]
   What is this
   creepy thing?

Skelly:
   ......
 
 [Granddaughter]
   Grandma keeps
   waiting for her
   grandson to come back.
   She always tells me
   stories about him...
   But we don't know
   where he is.
   If you ever meet him
   on your travels, please
   tell him grandma is
   waiting for him.
   I believe his name was...
   Skelly...
   
   I believe her grandson's
   name was...
   Skelly...

Skelly:
   ......!!!
 
 [Lisa's Shop, Termina (Another)]

Lisa:
   Well, Leena!!!
   Long time no see!
   How are you?
   Since when did YOU have
   a boyfriend...
   It's not fair to keep
   me out of the loop!

Leena:
   It's...it's nothing like that.
   He's...he's my cousin!!!

   Isn't that right, Serge?
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No

Lisa:
   Hmmm, a cousin, eh?
   Then, Serge,
   how about we leave
   Leena here and you and
   I go on a date?

Lisa:
   Oh, so she's your
   girlfriend?
   Hmmm...
   Well, if you still
   wanna go on a date,
   that's cool with me!

Leena:
   Oh Lisa, stop that nonsense!
   Oops, before I forget,
   this is for you.
   Mom told me to say hi.

Lisa:
   Wow, thank you!
   Thank your mom for me.
   So Miss,
   how can I help you today?
   Don't expect any special deals
   just because we're friends!
   
  [Lisa's Dad]
    Why, if it isn't Leena.
    What a pleasant surprise!
    The little girl I knew is all
    grown up now. And what's this?
    Have you come to show
    your boyfriend off?
 
 Leena:
   Oh, you're so silly!
   
Lisa:
   Yipes!
   The real Nikki!?
   This is so terrific!!!
   I'm you're biggest fan!!!
   May I have your autograph?
   It'll be my most precious
   treasure!

Nikki:
   ...I thought I wasn't
   your type?

Lisa:
   No, no... I mean
   Yes! You are!
   Ahahaha...!

   (I'd better not tell him
    I plan on selling it
    for a fortune...!)

Lisa:
   That's the rockin' bard,
   Nikki. He's the hottest
   star right now.
   He's holding a concert
   at the pier.
   It's gonna be the highlight
   of the festival!
   With that said, he's not
   exactly my type, though...
   
Lisa:
   !?
   Like, you're the
   real thing!!!
   Welcome!!!
   How would you like
   some Elements as a
   souvenir of Termina?

Member:
   What's this...?

Kid:
   The thing's fast asleep.
   What do we do now...?

Member:
   Is it asleep?
   we. can't get

Kid:
   Nice attitude, FREAK!
   We saved yer life!
   You could at least

   The least you could
   do is thank us!

Man:
   You're off to
   Viper Manor, right?

Man:
   Take me with you.

Kid:
   Who the bloody hell
   are you?

Kid:
   Hmm?
   I think I recognize
   you from a poster
   in Termina...

Member:
   Who are you?

Member:
   Actually...
   there was a poster
   of you in Terimina...

Kid:
   And what business do you
   have in Viper Manor?

Member:
   What business do you
   have in Viper Manor?

Nikki:
   I believe...
   my sister is
   in there...

Kid:
   Your sister...?

Member:
   sister...?
   
Nikki:
   Anyway...
   I'll let you in on a secret
   if you let me join your party.
   
   How about it?
   ~~~Sure
   ~~~Nah

Nikki:
   Rockin'!


Nikki:
   Noooooo...!

Nikki:
   I'm tagging along whether
   you like it or not!

   way into your band.

Nikki:
   I'm the rockin' bard,
   Nikki!

   How about a song?
   ~~~No, thanks
   ~~~Nah...
   ~~~Maybe later
   
Nikki:
   Oh...
   Fine...

Kid:
   Alright, so what's this
   secret you wanna tell us?

Member:
   So, what's
   the secret?

Nikki:
   In order to get inside Viper
   Manor, you have to go through
   the water vein further up...

Member:
   But there's a monster
   blocking the way...

Nikki:
   In order to move it, you
   have to feed it one of the
   monsters in the forest.
   I wasn't quite sure how
   to lure one to it, but
   then I found this
   notebook.
   It says to lure the
   monsters with their
   favorite food.

Member:
   Favorite food?

Nikki:
   It's probably talking
   about the plant life
   growing in this forest.
   The plants are attracted
   to a certain aroma and
   then emit their pollen.
   There are a total of
   three monsters in all,
   each of which has its
   preference in food.

Nikki:
   I'll be staying by the
   port in Termina.
   Call on me anytime.

Nikki:
   Well, that's that.
   And now, for a song...

   Kid:
   Alright, let's get goin'.

Member:
   Let's go.

Nikki:
   H-Hey!
   Wait for me!
 
 
 [This appears if you already chose a character]
 
Nikki:
   I see...

Nikki:
   Well, you did help
   me out back there.
   Here's the secret.

Nikki:
   You saw that monster
   blocking the path, right?

Nikki:
   In order to move it, you
   have to feed it these
   smaller monsters, but...
   I'll let you figure out
   the rest.

Nikki:
   Rock on.
   
   one bone different from the rest.

   ~~~Pick it up
   ~~~Forget it

   Angry Scapula!
   
Skelly:
   That's right!
   I was always pissed off
   about somethin'...
   I think I was angry at
   myself for havin' no
   talent...
   Everyone would just laugh
   at me or mock me...
   I hated myself...
   I'm sure you ain't
   interested.
   Let's just get goin'!
   
Member:
   So we have
   to wake
   this thing up.
   
Member:
   We have to
   defeat this thing.
   to get through.

Peppor:
   It's them again...
   those tough guys!
   You said you brought a
   shakingly awesome Element
   with you, didn't you?

Solt:
   I have a brilliantly
   brilliant Element
   this time, Peppor...
   It's a new...
   \'"\Summoning Element!\"'\

Peppor:
   Shaking!!!
   It sure sounds good.
   Well then, shake a leg!
   Hurry up and use it on
   these smart alecks!

Solt:
   Affirmatively affirmative!
   Here I go, Peppor...

Peppor:
   Huh?
   Nothing happened!
   I wonder what went
   wrong...?

Solt:
   Ah......!?
   I forgetfully forgot!
   You can't use a Summoning
   Element until all the
   Field Effect attributes
   are the same color!

Peppor:
   ......
   You muddle-head!
   Well then...hurry up and
   turn all the Field Effect
   attributes the same color
   and try again!

Solt:
   But, Peppor...
   You can't use the same
   Element twice in the same
   battle. Any foolish fool
   knows that!

Peppor:
   ...............
   ...............
   Oh my god, Solt!
   Can't you ever do
   anything right?

   Ahh la lah...?
   What should we do?
   We can't just barge in...

   I'll get you!
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   You won't
   get past us!
   
   COME ON!

   Is that all you got?
   
   This is it!
   
   Give it up.
   
   You won't get through here!

   Halt!

   I'll get you!

Pierre:
   A-Are you serious...?

Member:
   Are we leaving?
   But now's our chance.

   Excusez-moi...
   Are we leaving?
   But now's our chance.
   
Solt:
   What is it?
   Is there something
   wrongly wrong, Peppor?

Peppor:
   S-Someone shook
   the gate open.

Solt:
   You are...!?

   Peppor:
   Serge!

Solt:
   You cannot seriously be
   serious about coming
   through the front gate!?

Peppor:
   W-We're gonna shake it to you

Solt:

Peppor:
   Y-Yeah!

Peppor:
   Shake it and show a

Peppor:
   C'mon, shake it!
   
 [Battle]
   
Peppor:
   The nerve of these guys!
   Thinking they can storm
   our front gate!
   This time we ought to
   give them the shaking
   they deserve!

Solt:
   I agreeingly agree!

Peppor:
   Today we brought along
   a helping hand!
   He's tough!
   He's mean!
   And he's really,
   really big, too!
   Show them what
   you can do!!!
   ......
   I said show them

   Yoo~hoo!

Peppor:
   Hey!
   What the hell are you doing?
   What did you heal them for?

Solt:
   Well...
   I thought that we all wouldn't
   get to see how fiercely fierce
   Ketchop is if they were left
   exhausted like that!
  
Peppor:
   .........
   Have you got your
   priorities straight!?
   Doesn't that defeat
   our whole purpose!?
   Do it again, and you're
   shaken dead meat, Solt!

Ketchop:
   S-S-SSSAAAUUCCCE!
   (He seems angry...perhaps?)

Peppor:
   This doesn't look good!
   We could be shaken here...!
   Hey! Ketchop!

Pierre:
   Excusez-moi, but
   shouldn't we wait
   until nightfall?

Kid:
   Tch...
   Yeah, I guess...

Member:
   I guess so..

Member:
   Serge, shouldn't
   we. wait until nightfall?
   
   It leads down.

Member:
   We don't have time
   to be exploring
   other areas.
   
   It's locked.

Member:
   We need a key
   to open it.

Member:
   Any servant
   in Viper Manor
   should have one.

Member:
   There should be
   a dragon stable
   out back.

Kid:
   Bloody hell!
   I knew it was locked!

Kid:
   Serge, let's
   check out back.

Member:
   It won't open.

Member:
   Serge,
   let's check out back.

   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No

Member:
   We're not going back,
   are we?
   Now's our chance.


 [Viper Manor Stable (Another)]
 
 [Stablekeeper]
   Who are you?

   Oh yeah...
   You must be the
   new helpers I
   was told about.

   ~~~That's right
   ~~~No, we're not

   Oh great. You're just in time.

   My back gave out recently...
   and I can't feed the dragons.
   I want you to take over for me.

Member:
   Do you have a key
   to the manor?

 [Stablekeeper]
   Sure do. Wouldn't mind givin' it
   to ya if you take on this job.

Member:
   Do it, Serge..

 [Stablekeeper]
   HUH!? Intruders!?

   Hmmm...
   I don't know how you got in,
   but if you help me out,
   I won't report you.
   
   Will you feed 'em?
   ~~~Sure
   ~~~What do I do?
   ~~~No way

   Then, git the hell out!
   
   All you have to do is feed the
   dragons and satisfy their hunger.

   I'll give you a nicer gift
   depending on how many times
   you feed the dragons.

   First, go to the left-most feed
   station and press the x button
   to get the dragon feed.

   You can hold up to
   three servings at once.

   Next, use the directional buttons
   to move to a hungry dragon.
   Press the x button to feed it.

   When you run out of feed,
   go back to the feed station
   to replenish your stock.

   Just keep repeating
   the whole process.

   And remember, the dragons will
   only eat when they want to.

   You fail if you're unable to
   feed the same dragon 4 times.

   How many times?
   ~~~10 times
   ~~~20 times
   ~~~30 times
   ~~~40 times
   ~~~100 times
   
   Golly Gee! You'd better not!
   No one has ever been able to
   complete it.
   Although I did hear a tale
   about one legendary attempt...
   The man reached 99 before he
   suffered a heart attack.
   You still wanna try?

   ~~~Of course!
   ~~~I'll refrain

   Fine!
   Give it a try.

   Yes, wise choice.

   [Amount] times, eh?
   OK, I'll be countin'.

   Good luck to ya!
   
   Come back again sometime
   to feed the dragons.

   Oh, it's you.

   How 'bout it...?


   Don't be touchin' that!

   OK...
   That's it!

   No, no, no!
   You're making the
   dragons angry!
   I don't think you'll
   be doing that again!
   You better give up.

   No, no, no!
   You're making the
   dragons angry!
   100 times is impossible!
   You better give up.

   No, no, no!
   You're making
   the dragons angry!
   You're disgracing
   the good name of
   '"Master Dragon Feeder!"'

   No, no, no!
   You're making the
   dragons angry!
   You're too green!

   Good!

   Golly Gee!!!
   He succeeded again!

   You truly are a
   Master Dragon Feeder.

   Golly Gee!!!
   He succeeded!

   As of today, you are
   now officially the
   '"Master Dragon Feeder."'

   Excellent!
   A job well done.

   Here's a little somethin'.

   A job well done.

   You'll find the key
   in the cupboard.
   Take it.

   And here's the gift
   that I promised.

   But I see that you have
   already received a gift
   for this number of times.
   Only one gift per number.

   But I see that you have
   already received a gift
   for this number of times.

   But I see that you have

   Oh... I was going to give you a
   [Item] but you already have enough.

   But I see that you have
   already received a gift
   for this number of times.
   Only one gift per number.

   Come feed the dragons
   for me again, sometime.

   You truly are a master.
   I got no more gifts for you, but
   you still wanna try it anyway?

   ~~~Who's General Viper?
   ~~~Tell me about Viper Manor
   ~~~What's this Frozen Flame?
   ~~~Never mind...

Karsh:
   WHAT!? You dunno who I am!?
   What are you, rookies!?

Karsh:
   Well, listen up and
   don't forget!
   I'm one of the 4 Devas of
   the Acacia Dragoons, headed
   by General Viper.
   The name's Karsh!
   Gah-haha-ha-ha!

Karsh:
   I said I'm Karsh,
   didn't I!?

Karsh:
   Oh, you mean, junior.
   I had orders to bring in
   the ghost of that boy who
   died 10 years ago.
   But we had unexpected
   company and he got away.

Karsh:
   He seemed way too human
   to be a ghost, though...

Karsh:
   Aaah, I don't know what
   that guest from Porre
   wants with him.

Karsh:
   The general is the head of
   the Viper clan and has governed
   these islands for generations.

Karsh:
   But that's not all.
   When he was ordered to
   take up a new post
   on the main continent,
   he made quite an impact
   as the leader of the
   Acacia Dragoons and
   was promoted to general.

Karsh:
   He has retired from the
   army since then and currently
   serves as the lord of El Nido.

Karsh:
   This manor was built
   by the general's ancestors
   100 years ago,
   when people first began
   colonizing the El Nido
   Archipelago.

Karsh:
   Treat the place
   with respect!

Karsh:
   Aaaah... That's a top-priority,
   classified secret.
   Its existence has been rumored
   in the northern countries
   for generations...
   Legend claims it contains
   mysterious powers which can
   guide anima and change
   history...
   But no details are known.

Karsh:
   YO!
   Don't open that!

Karsh:
   I said don't...

Karsh:
   You're a pesky one,
   aren't ya...?

Karsh:
   CUT IT OUT!!!

Karsh:
   You're still at it!?

Karsh:
   You must be really bored...

   badly, take it.

   DAUGHTER, MISS Riddel, AND
   WAS NEXT IN LINE TO BECOME

   HOWEVER, HE DIED AN HONORABLE
   DEATH DURING HIS MISSION TO

   3 YEARS AGO.

Zoah:
   KARSH WAS ON THAT
   SAME MISSION, BUT REFUSES

Serge:
   Who are you?

Old Man:
   Hmmm... How do I explain...?
   I guess you could say I am
   the prophet of time.

Prophet:
   Listen carefully.

Prophet:
   The world is not just
   a single entity.
   Another world similar
   to our own exists in
   another dimension.
   There you will find what
   you might have become,
   a world of possibilities
   that might have existed,
   a whole history that has
   not been written yet...
   It is out there somewhere...
   We are simply unable to
   see, feel, or experience it.
   
Prophet:
   Serge... This world is not
   the world you grew up in.
   10 years ago, something
   happened that put your very
   soul teetering on the
   balancing scales of fate...
   with a fifty-fifty chance
   of life or death!
   This is when your future
   was split in twain.

Prophet:
   In your home world, you
   survived to live a happy
   and prosperous life.
   That is how you made it to
   the present point in time.
   However, here in this
   '"alternate"' world,
   you are, in fact,
   very dead and buried.
   You died 10 years ago, but
   this world's time line has
   flowed on regardless.
   You have no place in this world...
   Here, you are but a ghost
   brought back from the past!

Prophet:
   I do not know what
   happened 10 years ago...
   Nor can I guess what
   triggered your entrance
   into this world.

Prophet:
   The locations where such
   divisions in the time-space
   continua occur are called,
   '"ANGELUS ERRARE"' -
   '"Where Angels Lose Their Way."'
   It is said that, there, the
   borders of two dimensions
   fluctuate in such a way as to
   make the passage between the
   parallel realities a possibility.
   Perhaps in this world,
   you are the missing piece
   from a giant puzzle.
   And maybe, just maybe...
   the vacuum created by
   your non-existence here
   has drawn you across the
   border between the dimensions
   to fill the void in that puzzle.
   Of course, no one can
   say for sure.
   
Prophet:
   However, it appears as though
   these 2 worlds are connected
   by some unknown force.
   Depending on the location,
   the 2 worlds influence each
   other in strange ways.

Prophet:
   I am quite certain there is a
   wormhole that connects the
   2 parallel worlds...

Prophet:
   For your information, if
   you press the START button
   while on the world map,
   a menu window will appear
   that allows you to display
   which world you are in:
   Your Home World or
   Another World.
   Select ON to display this.

Kid:
   If what you say is true, and
   this world is an alternate
   reality...

Kid:
   Then why the bloody hell
   did Serge die...?

Kid:
   The reason has to be somethin'
   that happened 10 years ago!

Member:
   If what you say's true,
   and this world's
   an alternate reality...

Member:
   Then, why did
   Serge die...?

Member:
   The reason has to be
   something that happened
   10 years ago!
   
Prophet:
   You can only find
   out by moving on...

Marcy:
   No way I'm gonna let you!

Kid:
   Shut up, you little brat!
   
Nikki:
   ......
   Is Marcy your real name?

Marcy:
   Like... Whatever...!

Nikki:
   You...
   You look just
   like...mother...

Nikki:
   There's no doubt about it.
   You're my little sister!

Marcy:
   W-What's with you...?
   What-EVER!!!
   
Marcy:
   Can I!? Can I!?

Prophet:
   I guess it cannot be helped...
   This may be fate in itself.
   
Kid:
   We ain't here
   to play jacks!

Nikki:
   You're going to
   fight us?

Member:
   We don't have
   time for your
   silly games.

Prophet:
   I advise you not to
   take Marcy lightly.

Prophet:
   This child is one of the
   4 Devas, the highest rank
   of the Acacia Dragoons.

Kid:
   WHAT!?
   This little brat?

Member:
   You must be
   kidding!?

Marcy:
   Hee-Hee...!
   Too late now.

Nikki:
   You must be kidding.
   Marcy, think it over.

Marcy:
   Shut up, shut UP,
   SHUT UP!!!
   I don't know you and
   I don't have a family!!!

Marcy:
   Say bye-bye!
   
 [Battle]
 
 [Marcy]
   You think you're so smart!
   Then how about this...?

   Why you...!?!
   That does it!

   Oooohhhwww!
   I can't take thiiis!

   Take this!

   And this!

   And take that!

   And that!
   
Prophet:
   Marcy will not let you
   out unless you defeat her.
   
Marcy:
   Is that all you got!?
   I was just starting
   to have fun!
   NahÌ, nahÌ, na-na-nahÎ!!!
   
Marcy:
   Where do you think
   you're goin'!?
   
Marcy:
   Hmph!
   It's not over yet!
   I'll get you next time!
   
Nikki:
   Wait!
   Marcy, come back!
   
Prophet:
   Hoh-hoh-hoh...
   I did not think you would
   be able to defeat Marcy.

Prophet:
   Very well.
   I shall advise you
   of your next step.

Prophet:
   There are 8 pillars standing
   in the main hall.
   Behind the 2nd to last pillar
   on the left is a button
   to release the platform.

Prophet:
   Dragoons are not allowed
   up there, so it is best
   that you go up as you are.

Prophet:
   Beware, however...
   There is a much stronger
   being you will encounter.
   
Prophet:
   There are 8 pillars standing

   Behind the 2nd to last pillar
   on the left is a button
   to release the platform.

Prophet:
   Once the platform comes down,
   check the armrest of the chair.
   There will be a button
   to operate the platform.

Prophet:
   Good luck to you.

Kid:
   What?
   Did ya find somethin'?
   
Kid:
   Oi!
   Could this be...!?

Kid:
   Naah...
   It ain't the
   Frozen Flame.

Kid:
   Don't see any other
   booty here, either.

   I guess I betta ask
   the general directly.
   
General:
   What is it you
   wish to ask me?

Kid:
   ......!!!

General:
   My compliments on getting
   past my security.
   Now, may I ask you, who in
   heaven's name are you?

Kid:
   So you're General Viper?
   Don't feign ignorance
   on me now!
   Why did ya send yer dragoons

Viper:
   Serge...?
   My dragoons...?
   I'm afraid, my dear,
   I haven't the foggiest
   idea what you are
   talking about.

Mystery Man:
   General, I believe
   these vermin are here
   to see me.

   Well, it seems you have
   saved me the trouble
   of finding you!

   Young girl... Are you...?

Kid:
   What's the matter!?
   Cat got yer tongue!?
   I've finally caught you
   by the tail now, Lynx!
   I've come for two things...
   The Frozen Flame and
   yer life, ya murderer!!!

Lynx:
   Aha...
   So you must be Kid, then...
   A member of the fearsome
   band of thieves known as
   Radical Dreamers, correct?
   
Viper:
   Radical Dreamers...?
   This young lady...?

Lynx:
   Precisely!
   Don't let her innocence
   fool you, General.
   She's quite ferocious...

   Hah!
   Ferocious!?
   My arse...!
   After what you've done!

Lynx:
   I hate to disappoint you,
   but the Frozen Flame
   is not here.
   That fire lies hidden
   in the Sea of Eden,
   the place where past
   and future collide...

Kid:
   Alright then...
   It looks like I'll have to
   put that part off 'til later.
   In the meantime, I'll settle
   my score with you, Lynx!
   Prepare to meet yer maker!
   
Lynx:
   Ha!
   I have no business with you.

   Now come!

Lynx:
   There is no escape.
   
Kid:

   It was just
   a shadow!

Lynx:
   Did you think I would be
   stupid enough to pick a
   fight with a rabid dog?
   Why, just a shadow of
   mine is enough to deal
   with the likes of you!

Lynx:
   Now, Serge...
   What do you desire
   from this world?
   Do you wish to live again?
   Do you want to erase your
   demise from the pages of
   history?

Kid:
   What's wrong, Serge!?

Lynx:
   Listen to me...
   The end of the human
   world is nigh!
   When this time comes, Serge,
   there shall be a deep enmity
   between you and the world!
   This is not speculation
   or prediction...
   This is history!

Guldove -
Where ripples become waves...

 [Macha's House, Guldove (Another)]
 
Lady:
   You're finally awake?
   If you're looking for your
   friends, they're outside.

Lady:
   No, no, not that way.
   You go this way to
   get out.
   
Lady:
   Did you get a good night's rest?
   You can go outside through that
   door. Go say hi to your friends.
   
   Kid:
   Oi, Serge!
   Ya finally woke up, eh?

 [Guldove (Another)]
 
Kid:
   Give yer thanks to Korcha.
   He's the one that saved us
   after we fell off the cliff.

Korcha:
   No sweat.
   It's just part of my job
   as a ferryman.

Korcha:
   But I have to admit, you
   caught me by surprise when you
   came fallin' from the sky.
   You're lucky that it was the
   sea thatCHA fell into and
   not the rocks!

Young villager:
   Looks like you're
   in good shape.
   My name's Korcha.
   I work as a ferryman
   around the Termina area.
   You're in a small village
   called Guldove, a little
   west of Termina.
   I was on my way here when I
   saw you guys in trouble, so
   I just picked you up and
   brought you back with me.

Kid:
   But geez, you're
   such a wuss!
   How could you get
   knocked out from
   such a short fall!?

Kid:
   As for me...
   A little graze like this...
   ain't gonna...knock...me...down...
   
Korcha:
   Ugh, oh man!
   She's burnin' up!
   There's a clinic in this village.
   We should take her there.
   C'mon, I need your help, too!
   
 [Doctor's House, Guldove (Another)]
   
Doctor:
   It seems the patient has been
   poisoned with Hydra venom.
   I would say the most she has
   to live is about two days...
   If we had some Hydra Humour
   we would be able to
   neutralize the poison...

Korcha:
   Doc, if we find this
   Hydra Humour, we
   can save this girl?
   
 [Doc]
   Yes, but that's impossible now.
   Hydras are now extinct on
   El Nido...

Korcha:
   What do you mean, '"extinct?"'
   What's goin' on!?

Doc:
   Hydras are very rare
   and valuable creatures.

Doc:
   The blood, bones, meat...
   Every part is valuable.
   It's considered to be a
   panacea for various illnesses.
   That is the reason Hydras
   were hunted to extinction
   in El Nido.

   As a result, a whole species
   has been made extinct.
   Just to make a quick fortune.

Member:
   Is there no way to
   find this humour?
   If we could cross the 
   sea to the mainland,
   th1er1e might be
   a chance, right...?

Doc:
   ...That is not possible.
   The currents of El Nido are
   extremely dangerous, this
   time of year.
   It is highly improbable
   to cross the sea unless you
   are on a large vessel...

Doc:
   Even if you manage to get
   there, your chances of finding
   Hydra Humour are bleak...
   We do not have much time.

 [Korcha]
   ...Doctor?

Korcha:
   H-Hey, Doc!
   Where are you going!?
   Nothing's been resolved yet!

Doc:
   ...Excuse me.
   I need to be alone
   for a while.

[Member]:
   Serge,
   what are we.
   going to do?
   Kid is
   going to die
   if we leave
   her like this.

Korcha:
   I-Is this some kinda joke?
   Wait right here.
   I'll go get the doctor back!
 
 [Korcha]
   Whoa!

Korcha:
   Who the hell are you!?

 [Harle]
   What'z th1is? Non apologies
   for bumping into moi?
   Ooh la lah, don't you
   know any manners?

Harle:
   Ha haa, she is down
   for th1e count, just
   as I t'ought.

Harle:
   Serge, mon ami,
   why don't we just 
   leave her be?

Korcha:
   Who are you, and what's
   with that strange costume!?

Harle:
   Se taire!
   I have no buziness with
   no chicken-hawk.
   I am having a conversation
   with Serge.
   You're bothering moi, so
   keep your mouth shut.

 [Korcha]
   Why you...

Korcha:
   I ain't gonna letCHA barge
   into this room and get away
   with all the stuff you've said!
   You've made me mad.
   I'll show ya some manners!
   I'm not gonna cutCHA any slack
   just because you're a girl!

Harle:
   Try if you dare.
   I am not so weak as2 to
   be caught by a chicken-hawk!

Korcha:
   Heh, you've got some nerve.
   You're gonna regret it!
   Charge!!!

   Oops

Korcha:
   Dammit,
   where'd she go?

 [Harle]
   Ahahaha! You're amuzing.

Harle:
   Ahaha, such a simpleton.
   It's so much fun playing
   jokes on you.
   I was only here to see how
   she was doing, but I had
   fun while I was at it.

Harle:
   So long, Serge,
   au revoir, mon ami!
   Please dream of moi
   every night!
   Oui!

Korcha:
   ...Tsk, she's a loon.
   What's her deal?
   I just don't get it.
   
Korcha:
   Yo, Serge, are all of
   your friends like that?

Kid:
   Oooo......
   Serge......

Korcha:
   ...C'mon, go talk to her.
   
Member:
   Serge, 
   aren't you going
   to see Kid?
   
Korcha:
   ...WhatCHA doin'?
   Hurry up and go show
   her your face.
   
 [Demi-human Female]
   Even when she is suffering
   from a high fever, she is
   worrying about you, Serge...
   
Korcha:
   Hey, wait a minute!
   Where do ya think you're goin',
   leavin' a poor girl behind!?

Kid:
   Serge,
   I'll leave this...with you.
   It's my favorite amulet.

   Serge received
   Astral Amulet.

Kid:
   Remember what the...
   prophet said...
   Serge...
   Where did...it all start?
   Where...do angels...lose
   their way...?
   ...Try to...remember...Serge.

Kid:
   I'm feelin' a bit tired...
   I'm gonna rest up...
   for a while...

Korcha:
   You heard what the doc said.
   There are no more Hydras
   in this world.
   On top of that, there's no way
   to get to the mainland, and El
   Nido isn't that small a place.
   Are you gonna take a one-in-
   a-million chance to search for
   this thing, just to save a girl
   you barely even know?

Korcha:
   Hey, whatCHA gonna do?
   ~~~...I don't know
   ~~~Find a way to save her
   
 [Branch: Answering Yes. For No, search Branch: Answering No.]
 
Korcha:
   Alrighty then!
   I'll come along with ya.
   
Korcha:
   ...By the way, do you even
   have a clue where to start
   lookin'?

Korcha:
   Hey, do ya?

Korcha:
   Tsk, that's what I thought.
   Where in the world should
   we start...
   
Korcha:
   All we have left is that
   girl's amulet...
   Damn, what are we gonna do!?
   If only we had some kinda clue!
   
 [Demi-human Female]
   ...Um.

   Maybe you should go see
   the shaman?
   The shaman might be able to give
   you some clues from that amulet.

Korcha:
   ......
   That's right.
   The shaman...

Member:
   ...A shaman?
   that's an unfamiliar word.

Korcha:
   The shaman inherits the power
   of the Dragon God and governs
   the village.
   They're like a mayor or chief.
   The shaman might know
   something, although I can't say
   for sure. It's worth a try.

Korcha:
   We'll continue this outside.
   Let's decide what to do
   at the boat.
   
 [Korcha]
   Huh?
 
Korcha:
   Oh, you're...
   Luna, from Mel's place.
   What...
   
   Oh, hey...
   
Korcha:
   ......
   That Mel...
   What is she up to?

Korcha:
   What's up?
   It's just a cat.
   Strange guy.
   Come on, let's get
   goin'.
   
Korcha:
   We need to get goin' as soon
   as possible, but you probably
   need to equip yourselves, right?
   I'll be waitin' here.
   Call me when you're ready to go.
   We haven't got much time,
   so hurry.

Korcha:
   If you need to see the
   shaman, go down this way.
   Take the ladder to the second
   floor of the merchant tower
   and go left. There's a tower
   called the Dragon Shrine.
   Compared to Termina, this is a
   small village, so you shouldn't
   have any problems of getting
   lost.
   
Korcha:
   The Dragon Shrine is to the
   left on the second floor of
   the merchant tower. 
   Don't forget to ready
   your equipment when
   you have time.

 [Girl]
   Dear sirs, you're
   travelers, right?
   Although I hesitate to do so,
   I have a favor to ask of you.
   I received this bone from
   a trader, but I would like
   you to set it adrift in the seas...
   I'm sure its real owner
   would like to have it
   returned to nature...

   So, can you fulfill my request?
   ~~~OK, I'll do it
   ~~~Sorry, I can't help you

   Why thank you!
   Here it is. Please
   take good care of it.

   [Member] received
   Pelvic Bone.

   That's what I thought...
   I'm stumped. There's no point
   releasing it from the village,
   because it always drifts back.
   
Skelly:
   Yeah, you need guts
   to get through life!
   Hey...!?
   That's right!
   My favorite dish is
   Termina's famous
   squid gut pasta!
   
 [Orlha's Pub, Guldove (Another)]
 
Doc:
   ...Another life is about
   to slip through my hands...
   just like before.
   Nothing has changed at all
   by studying medicine...
   Man, I am so powerless...!

Orlha:
   ...So are you going to just
   give up on this life?
   That's not the case, is it...?
   If you don't, who else
   will help her back from the
   edge of life and death?

   ......

Orlha:
   I don't know your past.
   Living bound by the past
   is a very painful thing.
   You need to face reality
   head on...
   Running away isn't a sin, but
   it accomplishes nothing.

Doc:
   But I...

Orlha:
   One thing is different
   from the past, you have
   the ability...to heal.
   Everyone in the village
   recognizes that.
   Don't suffer by yourself...
   If you give up now, you will never
   be freed from your past.

Orlha:
   Now go...
   Don't let it end without
   doing something first.

Doc:
   I have done them a discourtesy...
   I am a failure as a doctor, but I
   must do what I can.
   Thanks, Orlha...
 
Orlha:
   Welcome.
   It's a small shop,
   but feel free to relax.
 
 [Doc's Clinic, Guldove (Another)]
 
Doc:
   This is the best I can do
   without the antidote.
   Now, it is a matter of how
   long the patient can hold
   on...
 
 [Assistant]
   ......
   
   Please don't give up hope.
   We will do best that we can...
   
 [Dragon Shrine, Guldove (Another)]
 
Shrine Maiden:
   Welcome to the Dragon Shrine.
   I am Steena, a shaman
   serving Village Chief and
   High Priestess Direa.
   I presume that you have come to
   this shrine seeking assistance?
   Please don't hesitate to ask
   Chief Direa for guidance...

Direa:
   ...You possess a young but
   gentle air about you...
   Hmm? There is an odd
   wind that is whirling about.
   I have heard that such wind-
   bearers appear at times, but...
   
Direa:
   ...Do you speak the truth?
   That you are already dead
   in this world...?

Direa:
   Hmm, I see...
   So that's why you have an
   odd air about you.
   As for a way to return to your
   original world, I do not know.
   But there are always reasons
   why such phenomena occur...

Direa:
   The Land of Genesis.
   Your only key may lie there...
   The key that connects
   your world, to this one.
   ...Shall we say, it is a
   '"Dimensional Distortion"'
   of sorts?

Steena:
   If events in your
   world are different
   from events here...
   It may be possible to
   save the girl, stricken
   with the Hydra poison.
   That is if the extinct Hydra
   still exists in your world...
   
Direa:
   One must choose their own path.
   But as long as we are human,
   one will sometimes become lost.
   I pray that your journey be
   blessed by the guidance of the
   great 6 Dragon Gods...
   
Steena:
   El Nido has long been called
   "'The Land Where the Dragons
   Sleep."'
   There are islands named
   after Dragons...and numerous
   Dragonian ruins and artifacts.
   You may have encountered
   some of these already.
   The most famous are the islands
   of the Sky Dragon, the Earth
   Dragon, and the Water Dragon.
   And the ancient ruin,
   '"Fort Dragonia,"'
   that lies to the east.
   Of the many Dragonian ruins,
   Fort Dragonia is one of the few
   that is still fully functional.

Direa:
   The key to activate
   this ruin is the
   '"Dragon Tear"'...
   It was given to our ancestors
   by the extinct Dragonians as a
   symbol of our friendship.
   It has been passed down
   through successive shamans,
   but...

Steena:
   It was stolen and taken away
   from Guldove by an unknown
   assailant.
   Their intent is unknown, but
   if they plan to activate the
   ancient ruin, a great
   disaster shall come about.

Direa:
   Our people have been
   searching for it, but...
   we have found no trace of it.
   
Steena:
   I will answer your questions 
   to the best of my knowledge.

Steena:
   What would you like to know?
   ~~~That's all I need for now
   ~~~The Land of Genesis
   ~~~The Dragon Tear
   ~~~The Dragonian Ruins
   ~~~The 6 Dragon Gods
   ~~~The Frozen Flame

Steena:
   What would you like to know?
   ~~~That's all I need for now
   ~~~The Land of Genesis
   ~~~The Dragon Tear
   ~~~The Dragonian Ruins
   ~~~The 6 Dragon Gods
   ~~~The Frozen Flame
   ~~~The Divine Dragon Falls

Steena:
   The Land of Genesis...
   I have no idea where it
   may lie...

Steena:
   But...all phenomena
   have their reasons...
   I feel that there is some
   other will acting behind this220
   something other than the fact
   that you are dead in this world.

Steena:
   The dimensional distortion that
   Chief Direa mentioned earlier...
   Assuming that this exists in the
   Land of Genesis, why could you
   not return to your real world?
   I find that truly puzzling...

Steena:
   I believe that there is a '"key
   item"' that you need to make
   the jump between worlds.
   Something that matches the
   missing piece of the puzzle.
   Something powerful enough to
   send Serge. back, who is
   a missing piece of this world...

Steena:
   It is a one-of-a-kind orb that
   our ancestors received from
   the now extinct Dragonians.
   Traditionally, it was passed
   down to each successive
   shaman, but someone has
   taken it away from Guldove.

Steena:
   According to legend, the Dragon
   Tear is required to activate the
   ruin of Fort Dragonia...
   It is a tough and steep trail
   to the top, not even the locals
   venture up there.
   But even so...
   If the assailant's goal is to
   activate the fort, it will
   certainly bring disaster
   to this world...

Direa:
   Nod... That is correct.
   This Dragonian ruin is a product
   of their '"crystal of wisdom."'
   Its power is unknown, yet much
   too powerful for any human.
   If the ruin were to be
   activated by chance, it would
   emit uncontrollable power...
   All would surely end in disaster.

Steena:
   But since the Dragon Tear was
   stolen, we cannot deny that this
   threat may become a reality.

Steena:
   The Dragonian artifacts are the
   many buildings and sculptures
   still found on El Nido today.
   But most of these have
   weathered away, and only
   a small portion of them
   remain intact.
   The only one that retains
   its complete form is
   Fort Dragonia, which we
   have discussed before.
   It stands at the peak of
   Mount Pyre.

Steena:
   Have you noticed that many
   of the islands were named
   after dragons?
   This is because those islands
   were where the Dragon Gods
   resided.
   But as human society grew less
   concerned for nature, the
   Dragon Gods chose to hide
   from the world's eyes...

Direa:
   'Tis sad...
   The mainland teachings state
   that humans and demi-humans
   are incompatible species.
   Is society moving farther and
   farther from living in harmony
   with nature?
   To consider separate
   even though the two
   are inseparable...?

Direa:
   Yet there is still one Dragon
   God that watches over us...
   The four-winged white dragon.
   His name, '"Sky Dragon"'...
   The pillar of the 6 Dragon Gods
   who has watched over El Nido
   through the ages.

Steena:
   As you may well know, the
   natural world is composed of
   a balance of the 6 Elements.
   These Elements are...
   White, black, red, blue,
   green, and yellow.
   Each one pairs up with another
   to maintain the balance which
   the natural world relies upon.

Direa:
   The gods that represent
   each Element are called the
   '"Dragon Gods."'
   Since they symbolize the
   powers of nature, they are
   also commonly referred to
   as the '"Gods of Nature."'

Steena:
   If the sun is white,
   the shadow is black...
   The flame red and
   the water blue...
   Green are the leaves of the
   forest and the blowing winds.
   Yellow are the forces of
   mother earth.

Steena:
   Long before man inhabited
   El Nido, the Dragon Gods have
   protected the lands.
   The islands are named after the
   Dragon Gods: Sky Dragon,
   Water Dragon, Earth Dragon...
   It is said that these Dragons
   once dwelled upon those isles.

Steena:
   But several hundred years have
   passed since settlers from the
   mainland came to El Nido.
   The only Dragons that can
   be seen today are the
   White and Black Dragons.
   No one knows the location
   of the other Dragon Gods...

Direa:
   ...It may be that they have
   withdrawn from the world to
   slumber away the aeons.

Direa:
   The number of outsiders seeking
   dragon lore and artifacts has
   been increasing in recent years.
   You may find it more beneficial
   to ask them about the Dragons,
   as we are bound by the ancient
   traditions...

Steena:
   ...A Frozen Flame?
   That is something we have not
   heard of in these parts.
   But, there is something
   about flames in the oral
   lore of our tribe.
   I do not know if this is
   related to the flame you
   speak of, but allow me to
   share it with you.
   
 [Steena]
   Be very careful when
   you stare into the flame...
   ~
   ~
   ~
   For the flame will also
   stare back at you...
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   It will either transform you
   into a different being...
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   ~
   Or burn you into ashes.

Steena:
   In an old poem of El Nido there is
   a phrase that refers to the evil
   sealed away by the 6 Dragons.
   This phrase follows after it:
   '"...the evil flame that sought to
   engulf the world..."'

Steena:
   ...An evil flame.
   If this refers to the
   Frozen Flame...
   It should not be in
   the hands of humans...
   Yet the truth about this
   story is unknown.

Steena:
   This was about a hundred years
   ago, before immigrants from the
   mainland came to El Nido.
   The now extinct Dragonians,
   demi-humans, and our ancestors
   lived on the main island and not
   on the outlying islands.

Direa:
   Yes, it was a time when dragon
   worship was still common...
   Humans and demi-humans lived
   together in the same community.
   It must be a little hard to
   imagine today, but it is true...
   The planet's power collects
   at certain points on the
   main island.

Direa:
   One such point is the
   place we call the
   '"Divine Dragon Falls."'
   But its name has been
   all but forgotten on
   the main island.
   Our tribe and the
   demi-humans are the
   only ones that know
   this name.

Steena:
   It is a sacred land that is
   dedicated to the worship of
   the sleeping Dragon Gods...
   For you to have accidently
   found this holy ground,
   means the planet might
   have guided you there...

Steena:
   May your journey be blessed
   with the guidance of the 6 great
   Dragon Gods...

   Hey, someone's life

   Hurry up will you!

Korcha:
   Are you ready this time?
   ~~~Wait just a bit longer
   ~~~I'm positively ready!

Korcha:
   ...Do you really want to
   save that girl or what?
   Hurry up and get ready!

Korcha:
   Alright, let's go.
   Please don't make me
   do this again, OK?
   
Korcha:
   Are you really sure?
   Don'tCHA dare tell me you
   want to come back later!
   Think about it really carefully.
   Are you positively sure?
   ~~~I'm ready
   ~~~Sorry, just a little longer

Korcha:
   Then get yourself ready.
   Someone's life depends on
   you, so hurry up!

   Geez...
   You've got no sense
   of urgency.

Korcha:
   Alright, we're off.
   All of you get in the boat.

   Who said you could dock
   that thing there!?
   Get that thing out of
   here, right now!

Korcha:
   Hey, don't be such a hardhead.
   It's not like we're robbin'
   from anyone.
   Besides, nobody else is
   dockin' here, right?

 [Overseer]
   That's not the point!
   What I'm trying to
   say is...

Korcha:
   Here, keep it.

 [Overseer]
   You can't bribe me
   with some...
   !!!

   Th-The delicious scent and
   this subtle texture...!
   This must be the famous,
   rare drink of Dragonians,
   the '"Dragon's Glory!"'

Korcha:
   (I thought this might
   happen, so I snagged some
   from my ma's kitchen.)

 [Overseer]
   A-Alright.
   I'll give you special
   permission this time.
   But next time I might
   not be so easy.
   When that happens...

Korcha:
   Don't worry.
   I'll get some more for you.

 [Overseer]
   Very well.
   Heh heh heh...
   You're pretty quick
   for a kid.

Korcha:
   If you don't hurry, that
   girl's gonna die.
   You two can't do this alone.
   Why don'tCHA let me come
   along?
   

Korcha:
   If you don't hurry, that
   girl's gonna be dead.
   What do you need?
   ~~~Return to Guldove
   ~~~Take Korcha with you
   ~~~It's nothing

Korcha:
   Whoa, whoa!
   Aren't you in a hurry!?
   Are ya sure you want to return?
   ~~~Return
   ~~~No, hold on a minute

Korcha:
   Are you serious?

Korcha:
   That girl's gonna be in
   serious condition if you
   don't hurry!
   
Korcha:
   Head back to Guldove?
   ~~~Return
   ~~~No, wait a minute
 
 [Boy]
   Wow, it's Korcha!
   I'm delighted to meet you!!!
   Um, Mr. Korcha,
   can you tell me how you
   built your boat?
   
Korcha:
   How, huh?
   There's not much to explain,
   since boats are more commonly
   used than shoes for movin'
   around in Guldove.
 
 [Boy]
   I get it!
   That's why Korcha's
   always barefoot!

Korcha:
   That's not exactly
   why...

 [Boy]
   Hey, weren't you
   on Korcha's boat the
   other day? I'm jealous...
   How was the ride?
   ~~~It was great!
   ~~~It was terrible!
   
   Just as I thought!
   Umm, one day,
   I want to build a
   ship just like it.
   
   Huh!?
   Really?
   That's weird...
   I wonder if the saying
   '"Ships are not what 
   they seem,"' is true...
   I gotta do some
   research on that...

   Someone must have been
   playing a prank.

Greco:
   Hmmm...
   Are you really a human who does
   not exist in this world...?
   You are now drifting between
   the boundaries of life and
   death...
   You are too young to be taken
   into the arms of darkness.
   Although it is in my best
   interest to aid you, my duty is
   to watch over the spirits here.

 [Romana]
   It's alright, Greco.
   I'll be here to keep
   things in order.

Greco:
   Romana, you are still too
   young to take on such a
   task!
   The spirits are always
   looking for a chance to
   draw the living into the
   darkness!

Romana:
   But my brother, Ghetz, was able
   to save you from being drawn
   into the dark!
   He gave his life to help you!

Greco:
   ......!!!

Romana:
   I am the sister of Ghetz...
   A small thing now and then
   won't get me down.
   This time, you must save
   this one from the darkness...
   I think Ghetz desires that, also.

Greco:
   Sí...
   You might be right.
   I believed that the only
   way to make up for my mistakes
   to Ghetz was to live in hiding
   for the rest of my life...
   I realize that I was only
   trying to escape from my
   responsibilities.

   May I assist you in escaping
   the darkness, amigo?

   ~~~No, not now

Zippa:
   Do ye know about this?
   There is an amazin' material
   called the '"rainbow,"'
   that can be forged into
   very fine items.
   When we were young, we went
   out to search for ourselves,
   but never found it...
   We've stopped searchin'
   when Karsh was born.
   Children are far more valuable
   than any treasure, ye know.
   But that man hasn't been shut
   down yet. Who knows when he
   might yell out that he's goin'
   back on his search.

 [Apprentice]
   He he he...
   The dragoons came by the
   other day and bought
   bushloads of armor.
   It's almost as if they're
   starting up a war or
   something.
   Thanks to that, I'll probably get
   a hefty share of cash today.
   Hee hee hee...

Zappa:
   Weapons are made for
   hurtin' other people.
   That's why we can't be happy
   by sellin' those things.

   that they never be used.

   Muah-hah-hah!!!

 [SnibGoblin]
   Humans destroyed the ecosystem

Macha:

   Where angels lose their way...
   I wonder if it's true
   that the flow of time
   has split in two?

Guile:
   Opassa Beach...
   Angelus Errare...
   Is it true that this
   place has split the
   flow of time in twain?

Pierre:
   This is Opassa Beach, oui?
   The place where the flow
   of time splits in two, non?

Greco:
   So this is Opassa Beach.
   It seems like a nice,
   tranquil place to me, amigo.

Mel:
   Where angels lose their way...?
   Does this beach have
   anything to do with it?

Leena:
   Serge... Is this where
   you came from? Is this how
   you came into our world?
   I knew it...
   It was Opassa Beach.

Nikki:

   just get on with it.
   I don't have time for a
   leisurely walk on the beach.

Guile:
   What do we do?

Pierre:
   Excusez-moi, but what
   do you want us to do here?
   It looks like an ordinary
   beach to me, Serge....
   Oh, anyone have a parasol
   they can lend moi?

Greco:
   What do we do
   now, amigo?

Mel:
   Hurry, Serge.!
   We don't have time for

   It's kinda scary going

Korcha:
   What the hell is this thing?
   I'm not really used to
   supernatural stuff.

Member:
   What is that...?
   Is it reacting
   to something?
   
Poshul:
   PO-SHU!?
   Ith thith what you
   call a wormhole?
   A hole that connects
   here and there?

Mojo:
   This is-om definitely
   a dimensional wormhole.
   A huge, unlucky, black hole
   that connects 2 worlds!
   Boogum! It's cursed!

Leena:
   So this is the wormhole?
   The dimensional wormhole
   that connects 2 worlds?

Korcha:
   So this is the hole that
   connects the 2 worlds...
   The whatCHAmacallit hole,
   right?

   dimensions?
   What a surprise-om!
   The world is full of mystery,
   but doon't foorget-om love
   and courage, too!

Leena:
   So we made it to the
   other world, right?
   Are you sure, Serge?
   I still find it hard to believe.

Member:
   So now we're in
   that other world...
   I still can't
   believe
   it, though.

Leena:
   ......
   You really are
   Serge, aren't you...?

Leena:
   You're alive in this world,
   living a normal life with me.

Leena:
   But in the other world,
   ...you're dead...
   And I'm living a different
   life without you...

Leena:
   Sure is strange, though...
   
Leena:
   You couldn't tell
   from the sea or the sky...
   They look the same...
   
Leena:
   So tell me, Serge.
   How's it going with
   the me in this world?

Leena:
   Have we kissed yet?
   
Leena:
   Well? Well?

   Come on!
   Tell me!
 
 [Arni (Home)]
 
Leena:
   Heeey!?
   That girl looks
   like me...!?
   
Leena:
   Hah-hah... Surprised?
   Well, there's something
   real deep behind all this.
   You should have Serge
   explain it to you.
   When it's all over, of course.
   
Leena:
   Wow... It just
   seems so weird.
   I don't know what's
   going on, but
   good luck!

Leena:
   You got it!
   Leave it to me!
   
Leena:
   Serge!
   Where have you been!?
   You had me worried sick!
   You just suddenly disappeared
   from the beach.
   That was some magic trick!
   Don't even think about
   pulling that one again.
   Once is enough for me.

[Hydra Marshes (Home)]

 [Man]
   Oh, you're with Leena.
   Well, I'm sure you'll be OK
   if she comes along, hehheh...

Leena:
   Hey!
   What do you mean by that!?

 [Man]
   Uhhh...well...ahh...nothing!

   You want to go further
   into the forest, right?
   Well, if it's the 3 of you,
   I'm sure you'll be OK.
   
   Do you have some kind
   of business here?

   ...Hmm, I won't ask you
   what it is. I can tell by
   the look on your face that
   it's something important.
   Here, go on through.
   I'm sure the 3 of you
   can handle yourselves.

   Before you enter here,
   I'll give you a word
   of advice...
   The marshes are like a
   maze full of poisonous
   monsters. Be prepared!
   
Korcha:
   WhatCHA doin' standin'
   there in a daze!?
   I hate cold and clammy
   places! Besides, we ain't
   got time to sit and toast
   '"marshmallows,"' man!

Member:
   Serge!
   What are you doing
   just standing there
   in a daze like that?
   We haven't got
   time to spare!
   let's keep moving!
   
Member:
   Everybody down!
   something big's
   heading our way!

Member:
   what was that thing?
   I can't believe this
   place!
   
Member:
   Did you just see
   a strange looking
   creature up ahead?

BubbaBeeba:
   This beeba no place
   for humans, beeba!
   Go away! Beeba off!

BubbaBeeba:
   If you beeba good and walk
   away, I will let you go.
   Beeba gone!

BubbaBeeba:
   You beeba too persistent...
   I will beebavenged!
   
Member:
   Why don't you try
   blowing the flute
   here, Serge?
   
BubbaBeeba:
   This beeba the wrong place!
   This isn't the '"wide open space"'
   I was talking about!

 [Member]
   ......
   
Member:
   A wide open space...
   Could this be it?

Member:
   Serge, why don't you
   try blowing that flute?
   
Member:
   Looks like we fell
   for its trap.
   It's do or die, now!

Member:
   Serge!
   Prepare for battle
   while we hold
   this thing off!
   There's nowhere to
   run as long as
   we're up this tree!

   Jump in the big hole?
   ~~~Go for it!
   ~~~Nah, too dangerous

Member:
   So this is Wingapede.
   It's actually smaller
   than I thought.

Member:
   Serge, why don't you
   try feeding it something?

Member:
   Hurry, Serge!
   we can't hold it
   off much longer!
   there's nowhere to run
   from up this tree!
   ~~~Just a bit longer
   ~~~OK, let's do it!
   
Member:
   The foothold could
   give way at any minute.
   Serge, we should
   avoid passing through
   the middle.
   
 [Cave, Hydra Marshes (Home)]

Member:
   Who would have thought
   there would be a cavern
   inside of this tree?
   Let alone this big,
   old monster!
   
Member:
   Well at least it served
   as a cushion to break
   our fall.
   Otherwise that
   would've hurt!

Member:
   If old five-legs here
   wakes up, we could
   be in a lot of trouble!
   We should try and
   get out of here
   while we still can!

Encaged Fairy:
   ............

Member:
   Hey, Serge!
   Is that really a fairy?
   I've never seen
   one before!

Member:
   We can't just leave
   her trapped like this!
   Let's help her out!

 [Pentapus]
   Wait right there...
   My darlings
   
   Do you think you can walk out
   of here alive?
   ...And with my dinner too?
   Come to think of it...
   It's been years since I wrapped
   my sweet tentacles around
   succulent humon flesh...!
   You'll make a fine main course
   to go with that delicious fairiii
   appetizer!
   You should consider it an
   honor to be the dinner
   guests of Madam Pentapus!
   
Member:
   I don't believe this!
   It's just one battle
   after another!

Member:
   But this time we're
   trapped in a hole!
   With no way out!
   We've got no
   choice but to fight!
   
Pentapus:
   Oh-hoohoohoo! Darlings...
   You're just trying to
   impress me!
   There's no way you can be
   excused from my table...
   No matter how many times
   you try!

Pentapus:
   Hoohoohoo! My darlings...
   Do you think I'm going to let my
   dinner get away from me that easily?
   Stop the useless resistance and
   accept your just desserts!
   ~~~Re-equip for rematch
   ~~~Continue useless resistance

Member:
   Hey, Serge!
   Aren't we going to
   help that fairy out?
   the poor thing could
   die if we leave it
   a prisoner in that
   cage like that!
   
Fairy:
   Thank you for rescuing me!
   You are kind of strong for
   human-folk! I was surprised!
   Let me introduce myself...
   My name is Razzly!
   I come from Water Dragon Isle.
   I think you can tell by just
   looking at me, but I'm a fairy!
   I guess you could say it's
   fairy obvious! Tee-hee-hee!
   
Leena:
   I've heard of that island.
   The old fisherman in my village
   sometimes spoke about it.
   But he says that because of the
   strange dry spell we've been
   having lately the island's
   water source has dried up!
   I wonder if it's the same
   thing in this world?
   
Member:
   I've heard rumors
   about that island
   they say that due to the 
   abnormal weather they've
   been having, their water
   source has dried up.
   But that was in the other
   world we just came from.
   I wonder if it's the 
   same thing in this world?

Razzly:
   Huh? Our water source
   has dried up...?
   This world...?
   I don't understand what
   in Fairy Godmother's name
   you are talking about!

Member:
   Serge...
   Perhaps we'd
   better explain!
   
Razzly
   Gee...
   So there's another world...?
   And you've come to these
   marshes in this world to
   save your friend in that
   other world?
   
Member:
   Yes...you seem to have got
   it. But actually Serge is
   originally from this world!
   we don't expect you to
   believe us but it is true!
   we traveled through
   a wormhole to your world!
   
Member:
   We need the hydra humour
   to make the medicine
   that'll save our friend!
   
Razzly:
   There sure is a Hydra
   in this forest. I saw it
   with my fairy own eyes!
   But that's when those
   big-noses caught me and
   threw me in here to
   become Pentapus bait!
   I want to go home to my
   island, but it's too far
   for a fairy like me to
   fly on my own!
   Tee-hee...
   How about taking me
   along with you!?
   
   
Razzly:
   Tee-hee, thanks!
   I'll be waiting by
   the forest entrance.
   Be fairy careful,
   Sergey!
   
Razzly:
   ............And......
   ...thank......you...for...coming...

Member:
   Those who don't learn
   the first time are bound to
   repeat the same mistake!

Member:
   We should get
   going before this
   thing wakes up.

 [Hydra Marshes (Home)]
 
Poshul:
   The Hydra mutht
   be up ahead.
   Ret'th go, Serge.!

Member:
   The Hydra must
   be up ahead.
   Let's go, Serge.!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   You befouler of
   the forests...!
   Human vermin!!!
   Prepare to receive
   the anger of nature
   that you so deserve! Hi-ho!
   O great Hydra!
   Hear my voice!
   Turn on these
   wretched humans...
   Teach them how the
   forest, no...our
   planet... is pained
   by their existence!
   Hi-ho, Hydra, away!
   
Razzly:
   Careful, Serge.!
   That's the Hydra you've
   been looking for!
   
DaggyDwarf:
   You've already gone far enough!
   We can't let you escape!
   Hi-hoooooooh!

DaggyDwarf:
   We must protect this forest...
   by finishing off anyone who
   has seen the Hydra!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   All you had to do was
   leave this forest quietly...
   It's too late for that now.
   
   
Member:
   We're surrounded!
   ~~~Prepare for battle
   ~~~Fight!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Hi-ho! It's no use!
   You can't escape from here!
   This forest will be
   your burial ground!

   ~~~Prepare for battle
   ~~~Fight!
   
DaffyDwarf:
   H-Hi-ho!?
   Do you have any idea
   what you have done!?
   
DaggyDwarf:
   This forest, too, will die.
   All because of you...humans...!
   We won't forget this! Hi-ho!

Dwarf Chieftain:
   What do you humans
   intend to do with
   our mother planet?
   Not thinking of the
   future...cutting
   down trees like
   there's no tomorrow!
   Burning the forests
   to make your towns
   even bigger!
   And all for what?

Dwarf Chieftain:
   Do you think that you
   are the only ones who
   live on this planet!?
   Do you even know the
   works of life-forms
   other than yourselves?
   Hi-ho!? Hi-ho!?

Dwarf Chieftain:
   Don't kid yourselves!
   You are just hairless
   apes! Or worse, hi-ho!
   You are nothing more
   than freaks of-of-of 
   evolution!!!!
   Hiiii-hooooowwww-ugh!
   
Razzly:
   It's fairy sad,
   but I can understand
   what he says...
   Why, we fairies are
   forest dwellers, too!
   But I don't think all
   humans are bad!
   I'm sure that there are
   many humanfolk who love
   greenery and are kind to
   the smallest of life-forms!

Razzly:
   I believe that is true!
   
Member:
   Wait a minute.
   we're not going to leave
   empty-handed, are we?
   We came all the way out
   here to save Kid.
   Don't tell me you
   forgot, Serge..
   
Razzly:
   Wait, Serge.!
   ...This Hydra...is holding
   newborns in her womb...
   Tee-Hee...
   The Hydra isn't extinct, and
   this forest isn't going to die...
   as long as there is life.
   
Razzly:
   All that may be left is a small,
   fragile, life force, but
   this forest will make it...
   
Member:
   There's not a single
   dwarf roaming this
   forest anymore...
   Have they abandoned
   this place?

Member:
   ...Let's hurry.
   
 [Termina (Another)]

   That's the stuff we needed to
   save that girl, huh!?
   Then there's no time to lose!
   Full speed ahead!
   ~~~Return to Guldove

   Let's rush that over to the
   doctor right away.
   C'mon! You guys hurry too!
   
Korcha:
   Gotta head back, full speed!
   ~~~Return to Guldove
   ~~~Wait a minute
   
 [Doc's House, Guldove (Another)]
 
Korcha:
   Hey, Serge..
   Let's hurry up and get that
   to the doctor right away!
   
Doc:
   ...Oh, it's you dudes.
   The patient's strength is at
   its limit. Without the antidote...
   
Doc:
   Can this be!?
   Hydra Humour...but how?
   We will discuss that later.
   As long as we have this, making
   an antidote will be easier than
   catching a wave!
   We can save the girl with this!!!

Doc:
   We will prepare an antidote
   right away. Nurse, help me with
   the preparations! Stat!

 [Demi-human Woman]
   Y-Yes!
   
Doc:
   I have no idea where in the
   world you found this...nor do
   I know who you really are...
   But now is not the time to
   ask such questions.
   You have done your part, now
   you can leave the rest to me.
   
Korcha:
   You heard the doc;
   we've done all we can.
   Just trust him and wait.
   
Member:
   It's already close
   to nightfall.

Korcha:
   Doc, how is she?
   Will she be alright?

Doc:
   Yes, she has passed the critical
   period. There are no signs of
   complications from the poison.
   The girl has held up well,
   but only thanks to you dudes.
   You have done the impossible by
   finding the antidote...
   I still cannot believe it...

Doc:
   You, with the red bandana,
   you are Serge, correct?
   She would like to speak with you.
   It would be a little while longer
   before she falls asleep from the
   anesthetic.
   Will you speak with her, dude?
   
Doc:
   I will be in the room next door,
   so call me when you need me.
   And do not forget that even
   though the poison is gone, she
   has not completely recovered.
   ...Well then,
   catch you later, dude.
   
   You haven't talked
   to Kid yet.
   There's no way you
   can leave the room!
   
Kid:
   Hehe, you've become
   bloody handsome while
   I was out of it.
   
Kid:
   I don't know all the details,
   but I heard what happened
   from the doc.
   Looks like there's been a lot
   goin' on while I was asleep...
   I guess it proves that you can
   take care of yerself now, eh?
   
Kid:
   ...Oi, Serge.
   Ya did good, mate. Why don't ya
   look cheerful for a change?
   
Kid:
   Ha, I would've been alright
   without any antidote at all!
   Struth...
   Now I owe ya one...

Kid:
   Serge...
   Thanks.
   
Korcha:
   ...is how it is, Doc.
   
Doc:
   ...A world different from
   our own?
   That is far out, man...!
   That there really is
   such a thing...
   And you dudes are from this
   other world, I presume?

Korcha:
   Just to make it clear, Doc.
   The only one that's from the
   other world is Serge..
   All the others, including myself,
   are from this world.
   We're all with him for different
   reasons, though.

Razzly:
   I'm from the same world
   as Serge. too.

Korcha:
   Whoops, my bad.
   I totally forgot.
   Come to think of it,
   the first time we met you
   was in the Hydra Marshes.

Razzly:
   Yes. If Serge. hadn't come
   and saved me, I would've been
   in big, big trouble.

Poshul:
   Ahem!
   Me wath with
   Sergeipoo, too!
   
Poshul:
   ......
   PO-SHU, why am I treated
   tho lightry!?

Korcha:
   U-Um, try not to worry
   about the details!
   It'll just make you tired, OK?
   
Poshul:
   .........

Doc:
   Another world...
   So I suppose some things are
   slightly different.
   The Hydra Marshes are a
   good example of this.
   Otherwise we would have never
   found a Hydra in this world.

Doc:
   Parallel worlds, never to cross
   each other, yet existing
   alongside one another...

Korcha:
   Hey, Doc, let's not think
   too deeply about this.
   There isn't any easy way to
   explain it.
   Even after going through it
   myself, I still doubt what I saw.
   Let's just drop the theories,
   Doc! The girl's been saved.
   That's all we need to know,
   right?

 [Demi-human Woman]
   ...Hahaha.
   That's very like you, Korcha.
   But he's got a point, doctor.

   Kid's life has been saved.
   I don't think we need to think
   about anything further for the
   time being.
   
Doc:
   Well, I guess you are right...
   I cannot find an answer to this
   by thinking about it on my own.

Doc:
   It is pretty late.
   We have been talking for
   quite some time...
   Let's call it a night.
   One good day's rest should be
   enough to let her get up and
   hang ten.
   
Kid:
   Whatcha gonna do, Serge?
   You've already found a way
   back to your own world, right?
   You could just go back home
   and live a peaceful life,
   pretending that nothin' ever
   happened.
   But can ya really forget
   everything you've seen here?
   And can ya live with yerself
   after ya turned yer back on us?
   
Kid:
   What are ya gonna do, Serge?
   ~~~Go back home
   ~~~I won't go back yet
   
Member:
   Serge,
   are you sure you're going
   to be satisfied with that?
   
Member:
   Think about it, Serge!
   Why did you take the 
   trouble to cross the 
   worlds to help Kid?
   It wasn't just because you
   wanted to go back to your
   world, right?
   You had other reasons to
   come back to this world!

Kid:
   I see...
   Then I'll stick around with
   ya a little longer.
   But just don't slow me
   down, ya hear?

Kid:
   I don't know what happened
   10 years ago...
   But it looks like Viper's mob
   has got something to do with it.
   Let's go after 'em.
   I need to go bash up that Lynx
   character and get me hands on
   the Frozen Flame!
   
Kid:
   Lynx...
   He stole something
   precious from me...
   He's taken away my future...!
   I'll find him!
   No matter what it takes!
   
Kid:
   Korcha,
   I heard that ya helped
   in the search, too.

Korcha:
   Hmph.
   It was nothing.

Kid:
   Yeah?
   Well, thanks for
   nothin' then...

 [Korcha]
   ...Now then.

Korcha:
   At one point I thought we were
   doomed for sure, but it looks
   like it's all settled now.

Korcha:
   All that's left is to take you
   guys back to Termina, right?
   My job ends there.
   You get a special discount price
   of 300G for the round trip.
   Sorry, but I need to make
   a livin' too.
 
Kid:
   Haha, you're pretty
   damn shrewd, eh?
   I shouldn't have
   thanked ya earlier.
 
   Hmm?

Korcha:
   What is it?
   Ya lookin' for
   something?

Kid:
   ...Hmm, yeah.
   Well, the Elements I had on
   me Grid are gone.

Kid:
   Oi, Serge.
   Didja remove the
   Elements from me Grid?
   
Kid:
   Hmm, if it wasn't you...
   then who did?
   
Korcha:
   The only ones looking over
   you while we were gone were
   the doc and the nurse.
   They should be in the room next
   door, so let's ask them when we
   head out.
   The doc should know something.
   
   Kid:
   ......
   I hope you're right.
   
Korcha:
   Huh?
   Mel, whatCHA doin'...

Mel:
   Hey, blondie!
   If you wantCHA stuff back,
   I challenge you to catch me!!!
   
 [Korcha]
   Mel, wai...
   
Doc:
   What is it, dude?
   Is Mel up to
   something again?

Korcha:
   Well, yeah.
   The same old mischief, but...
   This time, she's gone too far.

Korcha:
   Geez, that idiot...
   What is she thinkin'?
   I don't get it.
   I'm sorry about her, Kid.
   I'll get the stuff back from
   her later, so go easy on her,
   alright?

Kid:
   Ahh, that's no problem.
   It ain't anythin' I'll suffer
   without anyway.
   Not to be rude, but I don't have
   time to play around with brats.
   I've gotta go chase after Lynx,
   now!
   
Kid:
   Hmm, what is it, Serge?
   ~~~You need those Elements
   ~~~...It's nothing

Kid:
   ...Well, you're not wrong!
   But Korcha said that he'd
   get them back later.
   We don't have time to waste.
   Ain't that right, Serge?
   C'mon, mate, let's go.

   ~~~...Alright, let's go
   ~~~No, let's go after Mel

Kid:
   Why are you actin' so strange?
   Just when I thought you'd
   loosened up a little...
   Don't worry. Korcha said
   he'd get back me stolen
   stuff later.
   Let's just get a move on!
   
Kid:
   Ahh, alright.
   If ya insist.
   OK, then let's go find
   that brat right away.
   Time ain't gonna wait
   for us!

Kid:
   That's the plan, Korcha.
   Why don't ya help us out a bit.
   It'll be over a lot quicker
   that way.

Korcha:
   GotCHA!
   
Doc:
   Hmm, I am beginning to
   wonder if curing you was
   the right course of action.
   Such a ruckus in the clinic
   interferes with my work...
   But I guess your antics
   are proof of your youth, dude!

Korcha:
   Don'tCHA worry, Serge..
   Leave the rest up to me.
   I'll go grab that kid after
   I take you guys back to Termina.
   I won't make you guys wait long.

Doc:
   I have caused much trouble for
   you dudes with this incident.
   It is embarassing, as a doctor.
   I assume you are going to
   continue your journey?
   Try not to take too many risks.
   One must live strongly
   because life is limited!
 
 [Orlha's Restaurant, Guldove (Another)]
 
Orlha:
   Yes? Mel?
   She hasn't come by here
   today...
   Has she done something again?
   What did she do this time?
   Did she write graffiti
   on the walls again?
   
Korcha:
   Well, it's nothing big;
   if she isn't here, that's OK.
   
 [Guldove (Another)]
 
 [Man]
   Chief Direa is in prayer.
   You may not enter the shrine
   now, come back a little later.
   It shouldn't be that long.
   
   ...Hmm, what brings you
   here, Korcha?
   It's rare to see you come
   out to this tower.

Korcha:
   Oh, never mind that.
   By the way, have you
   seen Mel around here?
   We're lookin' for her right now.
   
 [Man]
   ...Mel?
   No, I haven't seen her today.
   Have you tried the residential
   tower?

Korcha:
   So, she hasn't come
   this way...
   Thanks for the info!

Korcha:
   As you've just heard, she hasn't
   come this way. The only place
   left is the residential tower.
   The sea is the only other place
   to hide, but that's not likely.
   Once we corner her, it's all
   over. Let's go!
   
Korcha:
   ...Huh?

 [Mel]
   ~!!!~

Korcha:
   Mel's heading for the
   residential tower!
   We've got her cornered now.
   OK, let's go!
   We should find her
   in no time.
   
Korcha:
   This is the end.
   There's no place to run.

Kid:
   So, what're we gonna do?
   If all three of us barge in
   at once, she's gonna escape.

Korcha:
   There are three exits
   to this tower.
   If we each go in through a
   different exit, there's no
   escape.

Korcha:
   Listen up. Don'tCHA dare
   let Mel get outside!
   
 [Boy]
   Leave it to me, bro!
   All I have to do is block
   this exit from Mel, right?

Korcha:
   Yup, I'm countin' on ya!

Korcha:
   Now, there are two more left.
   We'll even end up with some
   manpower to spare.
   It's game over, Mel.

Korcha:
   Let's do it!
   
 [Residential Tower, Guldove (Another)]
 
 [Mel]
   Waaaah...

Korcha:
   You idiot.
   That's whatCHA get for
   messin' with my customers!
   I'm not gonna forgive
   you just for cryin'!

Kid:
   That should be enough.
   We've got me stuff back, and
   there's been no harm done.

Korcha:
   ...Even so, we have to
   teach this kid some
   proper manners.
   You never know when
   she might do it again!

Kid:
   Don't worry about
   such minor stuff.
   I say it's already
   forgiven...
   Let's just leave
   it at that.

Kid:
   Besides...
   The little 'un's got some
   guts to steal from a member
   of the Radical Dreamers!
   Hahaha!!!

Mel:
   Hey!
   Don'tCHA call me
   a little 'un!
   I've got a name too,
   you know!?
   It's Mel!!!

Kid:
   Oooh, how feisty...!?
   So she's got real spirit,
   too!
   But weren't ya
   cryin' just now?
   Or were ya just fakin' it?
   I tell ya...
   She's gonna be a real mean
   one when she grows up!
   Hahaha!

Mel:
   ...WhatCHA mean by that?

Kid:
   Whoops! I guess you're
   still just a little 'un.
   Don't worry, just forget it!

Mel:
   Arrrgh... Ohhh,
   I said, don'tCHA call
   me a '"little 'un!!!"'

Korcha:
   ...Hey,
   are you sure you want
   to leave it at that?
   I just don't getCHA.
   Oh well, no use botherin'
   with it now.

Korcha:
   Then I'll go ahead and wait
   for you at the docks.
   Come and find me when
   you're ready to go.

Kid:
   Alright, let's get
   movin' then...
   
Mel:
   Mel won't cause anymore
   mischief. But promise to play
   with me again!
   
Korcha:
   You want to go back to Termina?
   ~~~Not yet
   ~~~Yep, back to Termina

Korcha:
   Take your time there's no rush.
   You probably won't be coming
   back here anytime soon anyway.
   I'll wait here for you until
   you're satisfied.
   Gimme a holler when you think
   you're ready to go.

Korcha:
   OK, let's go.
   Heh, it was nice knowing ya,
   but this is good-bye.
   
   
Korcha:
   I'll take care of getting
   back the stolen Elements,
   so don'tCHA worry.
   It was just a kid's prank,
   so go easy on her, alright?
   OK, then, come and find me
   when you're ready to go.

 [Termina (Another)]
 
Korcha:
   Here we are in Termina.
   You're on your own from
   here.
   
Kid:
   Oi, Serge,
   didja hear that?
   When I was snoozin'
   away in Guldove, Lynx
   and his mob hightailed
   it out of the manor.
   That fort's supposedly a ruin
   built by the extinct Dragonians...
   I heard there've been all
   kinds of mystic rituals there.
   It's said that the Dragon Tear
   was needed for the rituals...
   Bloody bastards, what are
   they up to now?
   Serge., this is no longer
   just our problem.
   If we don't stop these
   buggers now, they're
   gonna cause some major
   hell around here!
   
Member:
   Fort Dragonia is on
   top of Mount Pyre,
   southeast of hear.
   It'll be hard to get
   there by land, so...
   the question now is how are
   we going to get a boat?
   
 [Glenn]
   ~!?~

Glenn:
   Blonde braids...
   A blood red blouse...
   That sounds like the
   description of that
   thief from the Radical
   Dreamers...

Glenn:
   And that red bandana...
   He is just like the ghost
   Karsh was describing.

Kid:
   So what?
   Ya wanna take us on
   or somethin'?
   Sorry dorry, but we're
   in a bit of a rush....
   to that Fort Dragonia
   of yers...

Glenn:
   What business do you
   have at the fort...?
   That makes me even
   more suspicious...
   I will draw my
   sword if needs be...

 [Woman]
   Oh, Glenn,
   stop that!
   Your brother would never
   have drawn a sword in
   such circumstances!

Glenn:
   Leave my brother
   out of this!
   
Kid:
   Oi, don't get yer knickers
   in a knot...
   I don't care if ya draw
   yer sword or what, but I
   ain't stoppin' for ya.
   See ya!

Glenn:
   All right.
   Forgive me for my
   rash behavior...
   Come to think of it,
   I really have no interest
   in who you are.
   Really, I only want to
   know the truth of what
   is happening here.
   I shall follow my own way
   to find the truth.
   
Glenn:
   If you intend to
   go to the fort, I would
   offer you a word of advice.
   When you get on your boat,
   first head north, and then east.
   You should find a small
   island there.
   A retired dragoon now
   lives there.
   Find him and ask for
   his advice.
   There are many frightful
   rumors about that fort,
   you know. You never know
   what to expect there.

Kid:
   All we need to do now
   is to find a boat!
   Let's git a move on it!
 
Korcha:
   You guys need to
   cross the sea?
   Then I might, just
   might, think about
   lending you my boat.
   With two conditions...

Kid:
   Ha, with that clunky boat
   of yers, I don't think we're
   gonna survive a round trip.
   But I guess this ain't the
   time to be picky.
   So, Korcha, what are yer
   conditions?
 
Korcha:
   First, if you ever find the
   Dragon Tear, give it to me.

Korcha:
   The other condition is...
   O-Once all this ruckus
   is over...
   Um...
   I wantCHA to...
   Mumble, mumble...
   
Kid:
   What was that?
   Stop mumblin' and
   speak up.
   I can't hear ya.
   
Korcha:
   I a...
   Arrgh...
   I wantCHA to be my wife!
   
Kid:
   Huh...?
   What...did you
   just say?

Korcha:
   I said,
   '"I WANTCHA TO BE MY WIFE!"'
   
Kid:
   ...!!!
   Oi, Korcha!!!
   Don't mess with me!
   I'm gonna kick yer arse
   so hard you'll kiss
   the moons!

Korcha:
   I'm not joking!
   To tell you the truth,
   I, um...
   That it...
   It was...
   love at first sight...

Kid:
   Mmmnn...!
   Oi, ya know who I
   am, don't ya!?
   
Korcha:
   Yeah, you're some kind of
   thief, ain'tCHA?
   Don'tCHA worry.
   I don't care about your past,
   and I don't wantCHA to feel
   forced.
   We can wait until all
   this fuss is over.
   So, please...
   
Kid:
   Mmmghh...!
   
   ~~~Just tell him that you will
   ~~~Refuse

Kid:
   Serge,
   this is none of yer business.
   It's me own problem!

Kid:
   OK, understood!
   But this ain't somethin'
   I can agree to on a whim.

Kid:
   I'll consider it.
   Until I settle the score
   with Lynx, that is.
   That's about the best I
   can promise.
   I can't guarantee you
   anythin' more.
   
Korcha:
   Alright, that's all
   I need for now.
   OK, I'll lend you the boat.

Kid:
   Glenn,
   what was it you were
   sayin' earlier?
   Somethin' 'bout goin' to see
   an old man on a small island
   to the east...
   
Glenn:
   First, head north and then
   east by boat. There is a
   small island there.
   A retired dragoon
   named Radius lives
   on that island.

Kid:
   What was that Glenn guy
   sayin' earlier?
   Somethin' 'bout goin' to see
   an old man on a small island
   to the east...

Korcha:
   Hey, you be careful with
   yourself from now on.
   Just remember that your life
   is not just your own anymore.
   You're carrying my 
   wife-to-be.
   
Kid:
   Brrrhh! (Goose bumps!!!)
   
Korcha:
   Do you want me to come
   with you?
   ~~~Take him with you
   ~~~Don't take him with you

Korcha:
   OK, then I'll be heading
   home now. Remember that
   I'm just LENDING you my boat!
   Don'tCHA dare sink it!
   Take care!

   
Kid:
   ......
   This is getting
   bloody crazy...

Kid:
   Looks like we got
   Korcha to lend
   us his boat.
   
 [Branch: Answering No. For Yes, search Branch: Answering Yes.]
 
 [Doc's House, Guldove (Another)]
 
Korcha:
   Hey, wait a minute!
   She's your partner, ain't she?
   Aren'tCHA gonna do anything?

   ~~~...There's nothing we can do
   ~~~I'll find a way to save her

Korcha:
   You scared me for a second...
   Heh, I've come this far,
   I'll tag along with ya!

Korcha:
   ...Hold it right there.

Korcha:
   You've got no right to keep
   that girl's amulet.
   Leave that thing here.

Korcha:
   What's wrong?
   Hurry it up.

   Astral Amulet.
   
Korcha:
   Tsk, this is disgustin'.
   ...It's turnin' out to be a
   baaad day.
   
 [Residential Tower, Guldove (Another)]
 
Korcha:
   What do you want?
   Ya need something from me?
   I don't want nothing to
   do with you.
   Get outta here.

Korcha:
   You've got something to say?
   ~~~I need to borrow your boat
   ~~~......

Korcha:
   Ha, it's got nothing to
   do with me.
   You're distracting me by
   standing there.
   Will ya hurry up and get
   out of the room?
   
Korcha:
   Lend you my boat?
   Ha, no way!
   Why should I lend you my boat?
   Sorry, pal, go find someone else.

 [Macha]
   Hold it right there!!!

Korcha:
   M-M-Ma!!!
   Why are you here? You said
   you were goin' shoppin'!?

Korcha's ma:
   Don'tCHA start arguin' with me!
   Aren'tCHA gonna help your
   friends when they need you?
   I thought you were actin'
   strange when you came home,
   but I don't remember raisin'
   my son to be so inconsiderate!
   
Korcha:
   O-Oh leave me alone!
   These guys ain't no
   friends of mine!
   In the first place, this has got
   nothing to do with you, ma.
   Why should I lend my boat to
   guys who abandon their own
   partners!?
   
Korcha's ma:
   Hey, wait a second.
   After overhearing that,
   I can't letCHA give up
   on your partners.
   Hmm, I don't see that
   blonde girl in red.
   What happened to her?

Korcha's ma:
   So what's goin' on?
   I'd like you to tell this
   ol' lady your story.
   
Korcha's ma:
   ...I see.
   That's why she isn't here.
   That explains why you were
   upset when you came back...
   You're a helpless boy
   aren'tCHA?
   
Korcha's ma:
   This boy only said he doesn't
   know what to do. Don'tCHA think
   that's a natural response?
   You were just sayin' that out
   of spite. What would you have
   done if you were in his shoes?
   Come on, speak up, Korcha.

Korcha:
   Ugh...um, well...
   
Korcha's ma:
   You see?
   You're just the same.
   Now apologize to this boy.

Korcha:
   S-Sorry about that...
   I just lost my temper.
  
Korcha's ma:
   Good, that's settled.
   Now thatCHA understand,
   go help these kids out.
   
Korcha:
   H-Hey, that's a completely
   different story, ma.
   I can't lend them my boat...

Korcha's ma:
   Don't be such a miser.
   Just lend them a boat or two.
   If you're so worried about the
   boat, just tag along with them.
   It's that simple, Korcha.

Korcha:
   You say a boat or two, but...
   That's the only one I have.
   Besides, I've got nothin'
   to do with...

Korcha's ma:
   You're such a blockhead.
   Then I will borrow that boat.
   You never stay put, so it's a
   good time to do your chores.
   Go take care of Mel while
   you're at it.
   Do you understand?

 [Korcha]
   Oh gawd! You gotta be kiddin'...
   
Korcha's ma:
   Now, what is your name,
   young man?
   
Korcha's ma:
   Your name is Serge...
   OK then, Serge., nice
   to meetCHA!
   My name is Macha.
   You can call me ma or
   Macha, or whatever you like.
   
Macha:
   I'll be waitin' at the docks.
   Call me when you're ready to
   leave the village.
   By the way, Serge..
   You should go see the
   village shaman.
   You look like you are lost,
   and she might be able to help
   you get back on your path...
   
 [Macha]
   Alrighty.
   
Macha:
   Oops, I almost forgot.
   I came back to get some
   things I left behind.
   
Macha:
   OK, Serge..
   I'll be waiting for you at
   the docks.
   
Macha:
   OK, Serge..
   Call me when you're
   ready to go.
   This isn't anything special,
   but go ahead and keep it.
   You know what frames
   are, right?
   This frame is called
   '"Tropical Paradise."'

Korcha:
   Don't get me wrong!
   I'm only lending you the boat
   because ma said to.
   
 [Guldove (Another)]
 
Macha:
   Serge, you haven't
   met the shaman yet?
   Oops... Sorry about that.
   I forgot to tell you where
   she is.
   All you need to do, is go
   straight down this way, get
   to the second floor and keep
   going left.
   That leads you down to
   the Dragon Shrine.
   
Macha:
   Are you ready?
   ~~~Not yet
   ~~~Ready

Macha:
   Is that so?
   Well, there's no rush.
   Just take your time.

Macha:
   OK then, let's get going.
   Alright boys and girls,
   all of you get on the boat!

 [Termina (Another)]
 
 [Overseer] 
   HEY!!!

   By whose permission
   are you docking that
   boat there!
   Get that thing out of
   here, right now!

Macha:
   Hmm?
   You got a problem with that?
   Ya don't see any other boats
   needin' to dock, do you?

 [Overseer]
   That's not the point!
   What I'm trying to
   say is...

Macha:
   Ah, cut the jive-talk!!!

 [Overseer]
   Y-Yes ma'am...
   
   That's why I can't
   stand mamas...

Macha:
   OK, we're in Termina.
   Do whatCHA need to do!
   
Glenn:
   The general and his men are
   headed for Fort Dragonia.
   There has been word that
   the major power of the East,
   Porre, is up to something
   suspicious.
   They seem to have heard
   the rumors of the
   Frozen Flame in El Nido and
   are coming to investigate.

 [Woman]
   My, then that means the
   Porre army might invade
   this town any time now.
   I wonder if we will
   be alright...

Glenn:
   Yes, that is why we
   are moving to the fort
   for a while.
   That fort is far from town
   so it is not used normally,
   but it has good defenses.
   I was ordered to remain at
   the manor and protect Miss
   Riddel, but...
   She felt very uneasy about
   the way General Viper
   was acting before he left,
   so...

 [Woman]
   What are you going
   to do? Aren't you going
   to get in trouble if
   you leave the manor?

Glenn:
   Yes...
   Still, I cannot stop thinking
   about it, so I am planning to
   infiltrate the fort by boat.

 [Woman]
   Are you sure about that?
   If worse comes to worst,
   you might be discharged
   from the Acacia Dragoons.

Glenn:
   Yes. I will act in accordance
   with my faith, even if I have
   to break military regulations.
   I must go.
   Ma'am, I will come back to
   buy flowers from you when
   I return!

 [Woman]
   Take care!
   
Macha:
   I'm gonna head home soon,
   but whatCHA gonna do now?
   I don't know what happened ten
   years ago or what's goin' on
   now, but don'tCHA wanna get
   things straight?
   Or do you just wanna go live
   somewhere in peace and quiet?
   ~~~Straighten things out
   ~~~Live quietly
   
Macha:
   Hmm, well if you say so.
   There's nothing more for me to
   say about it.
   You don't have to make some
   epic journey to find happiness.
   But this ol' lady thinks you
   should have a little more
   adventure when you're young.
   You sure you wanna stop here?
   ~~~No, I'll set things straight!
   ~~~Yes, I'll live on quietly

Macha:
   That a boy!
   I knew you wouldn't
   give up!
   Life is a journey to
   find yourself.
   That's how everyone
   grows up...
   So, where do we go
   to find out what's
   goin' on?
   What? So you say we
   need to go after Lynx
   and General Viper
   to Fort Dragonia?

Macha:
   Did you hear?
   Fort Dragonia is a ruin
   of the extinct Dragonians...
   People say they conducted
   strange ceremonies, and
   most folks from Guldove
   won't go near the place...
   You gotta wonder what
   they're up to with the
   Dragon Tear there.
   It gives me the chills.
   Also, you've got to go through
   Mount Pyre to get to that fort.
   You're gonna need to get there
   by boat...

   ~!!!~

Macha:
   I know!
   You can borrow this boat.
   Just a little farewell gift
   from me.
   Don't worry!
   That brat son o' mine's not
   gonna use it for anythin'
   good anyway!

   from Macha!
   
Glenn:
   I need to borrow a boat...
   
Macha:
   Oops, you are just
   a tad too late.
   I just lent this boat
   to someone else.
   Ask this boy here.

Glenn:
   I need to borrow a boat...
   I am trying to get to
   Fort Dragonia.

Macha:
   Fort Dragonia!?
   Wow, what a coincidence!
   These boys have some
   business there, too!

Glenn:
   You are...
   You are the young man
   that gave us the bellflower...
   Thank you again.
   Miss Riddel greatly
   appreciated your kindness.

Macha:
   You two already know
   each other?
   What great timing!
   On the road you need a
   companion, in life you
   need kindness.
   Join in with them on their
   trip to the fort.

Glenn:
   But what business brings you
   to Fort Dragonia...?
   And that red bandana...
   It all seems similar
   to some ghost Karsh was
   telling me about.

Macha:
   Ahh, you city-folk try to make
   things too complicated!
   That's got nothin' to do
   with you, right?
   This poor boy's got his own
   problems, too!!!
   Why don'tCHA ask him his
   story to pass time while
   you're travelling?

Glenn:
   Uh, y-yes...
   I guess you are right.

Glenn:
   So what will it be?
   ~~~Let him join
   ~~~Don't let him join

Glenn:
   Thank you...
   I have a suggestion before
   heading to the fort.
   When we get on the boat,
   first head north and then east.
   You should find a small
   island there.
   A retired Master Knight
   of the Dragoons named
   Radius lives there now.
   When me and my big brother
   were young, he used to look
   after us quite often.
   We should go ask for
   his advice before going
   any further.
   There are many frightful
   rumors about that fort.
   Who knows what to expect
   there.

Macha:
   Serge.!!!
   Why are you tryin' to leave
   this poor boy out?
   Don'tCHA need all the
   help you can get right
   now?
   I mean, he even looks
   like a knight!
   Be a good boy, and take
   him with you!

Glenn:
   Thank you...

   Macha:
   I'm a little worried about you...
   Do you want me to come along?
   ~~~Let her join
   ~~~No, thanks

   
Macha:
   Then I'll be headin' home.
   That mischievous son of mine's
   probably starving back home.
   Be careful out there.
   If you ever need something,
   stop by Guldove again!
  
 [Woman]
   Just remember, Glenn,
   don't push yourself
   too hard.
   If you die, you'll never
   accomplish all those
   things you want to do.
   
 [Fortune Teller]
   Hahah...!
   Sir Guile,
   the deadline has
   already passed!
   
Guile:
   ...Ma'am, this time
   I have lost.
   I have found the item
   in question, though it
   was too late...

 [Fortune Teller]
   Grin...
   Sir Guile, how did it go?
   Did you find the item?

Guile:
   See for yourself, ma'am.
   Here is proof of my intrusion
   into Viper Manor.
   I ask that you give me
   my reward, as promised 
   at the conclusion of our bet.

 [Fortune Teller]
   Ummm...
   It is my loss this time.
   Here is the reward I promised.
   Take it away!
   
 [Fortune Teller]
   Grin...
   Sir Guile, how did it go?
   Did you find the item?
   
Guile:
   ...Ma'am, I have
   lost this time.
   I was able to penetrate
   into the manor, but...

 [Fortune Teller]
   Don't start whining!
   A promise is a promise.
   Now, take off your mask
   and let me see your face.

Guile:
   ...Nod
   I guess I have no choice...

 [Fortune Teller]
   M-My word!!!
   
   I see, so that's what
   it was...
   These old bones have
   just shaved an hour
   off their life-span...
   
Guile:
   Ma'am, I have learned that
   the world is full of
   '"enigma."'
   I will be joining their journey
   for a while. Take care, and we
   might engage in another high-
   stake gamble again.

 [Fortune Teller]
   You bet!

Nikki:
   I'll be gone for a while...
   But don't worry. I'll be
   back when the gig's over.
   
Miki:
   I'm not going to
   search for you again!

Nikki:
   I'll be gone for a while...
   Don't worry, man. I'll definitely
   come back when the gig's over.

 [Roadie]
   Yeah, don't worry about it.
   The concert's postponed
   indefinitely anyway.

Glenn:
   ......
   Now...this brings back
   some memories.

 [Flashback]

Riddel:
   Looks like Dario took the
   championship after all.

Karsh:
   Ha! I almost had ya
   there, though.
   It won't be the same
   next year, Dario.
   Next time, I'll take the
   trophy!

Dario:
   Haha, good luck, Karsh.

Karsh:
   What caught me by surprise
   this time was Glenn.
   Since when did he improve
   his skills so much?
   We've got to watch out for
   him next time.
   Ain't I right,
   Glenn?

 [Glenn]
   ~!!!~

Karsh:
   Glenn?
   Waddaya doing?

Glenn:
   Oh, uh n-nothing!
   But wow, both Dario and
   Karsh are great!
   Compared to that, I've still
   got a long way to go to win.

Karsh:
   Weird kid...
   Don't worry.
   You'll be celebrating with
   the winner's trophy in
   no time!

Karsh:
   Well, maybe not while I'm
   still around, though!!!
   Hahaha!

Riddel:
   What's with this big mouth
   of yours!
   Glenn, pay him no heed.
   Don't hold back!

Karsh:
   Ah, come on. Lady Riddel is
   always on the brothers' side!
   Will ya come and be on my side
   once in a while?

Riddel:
   Oh, but that's not true.
   I'm always cheering for the
   three of you.
   As long as you're all safe,
   I'm content.
   As long as it is peaceful,
   and we can all talk together
   like this...
   I wish that it would always be
   this way. That is my most
   deepest wish...

Dario:
   ......

   Now is not the time
   to get sentimental...

 [Girl]
   Mr. Glenn!
   Can you help me?
   These two just won't
   stop fighting.
   Mr. Glenn, when you used
   to live here, you didn't
   fight, did you?
   Please, tell them to
   stop!

Glenn:
   Ha ha ha!
   There is no such thing as
   brothers that do not fight
   with one another.
   Even we fought, sometimes.
   But, when Dario realized that
   he was at fault, he would always
   apologize to me later.
   You can fight, but you
   must learn something from it!

Glenn:
   So, what are you fighting
   about?

Glenn:
   Ha ha ha!
   There is no such thing as
   brothers that do not fight
   with one another.
   Even we fought, sometimes.
   But, when Dario realized that
   he was at fault, he would always
   apologize to me later.
   You can fight, but you
   must learn something from it!

Glenn:
   So, what are you fighting
   about?

 [Brother]
   Listen up!
   Big brother says that
   he's going to make Marina
   his bride!

 [Glenn]
   ...!?

Glenn:
   ...His bride?

 [Brother]
   I'm gonna marry Marina!!!

 [Brother]
   M-Me too!
   I want to start a happy
   family with Marina!!!

Glenn:
   ......
   Whoa, you two are mature
   for your ages.
   But have you asked Marina
   how she feels about it?

 [Brother]
   How do you feel, Marina?

 [Girl]
   H-How do I feel...
   Um, well...
   I like you both!

Glenn:
   Marina, these two are serious.
   It is best if you tell them
   how you truly feel.

Glenn:
   Marina, these two are serious.
   It is best if you tell them
   how you truly feel.

 [Girl]
   Uh, ummm...
   Th-The one I really like is
   John, who's training outside
   to become a hero...
   But John already has a girlfriend,
   Annie, so...

 [Brother]
   Oh my gawd!!!

 [Brother]
   Nooo!
   You gotta be kidding!!!

Glenn:
   ...This might be a bit hard
   to take, but I guess it can't
   be helped.
   But I guess it is better than
   her liking one of you more than
   the other...

 [Girl]
   Huh...?

Glenn:
   Uh, ahem.
   Nevermind...
   Even if you do not marry
   one of them, try to get
   along with them, alright?

 [Girl]
   Y-Yes...
   I'll do my best.

Glenn:
   Call me whenever you need
   help!
   
   [Residential Tower, Guldove (Another)]
   
Macha:
   Welcome, Serge..
   Call me whenever you
   need my help.
   If you want, I can help
   you right now!
   ~~~Thanks, maybe next time
   ~~~Please help me

Macha:
   Then take care of yourself.
   Don'tCHA get in over your
   head, do you hear me?

Macha:
   Right on, leave it to me!
   Nothing's more powerful
   than a mother's love!

Macha:
   ...Ahh.
   My help isn't needed this time.
   Too bad.

   Oh, it's you guys again.
   Didja come by to laugh at me?

   Glenn:
   What on earth happened!?
   Could Lynx have done
   this!?

Member:
   What happened here!?
   Did Lynx do this!?
   
 [Harle]
   Zat'z correct.
   Hmm... Maybe not?
   
Harle:
   Ze correct answer iz,
   I did zis under
   Monsieur Lynx's order.
   
Harle:
   Salut, Serge.
   Did you miss moi?
   
Glenn:
   Harle!!!
   What have you done
   with Radius!?
   
Harle:
   Ooh lah lah...
   Glenn...
   You're all fired up.
   
Harle:
   Oooooooh...!
   
Glenn:
   Tell me!!!
   
Harle:
   Tsk, tsk, tsk!
   
Harle:
   Excusez-moi, Serge,
   but do you want to know why
   I burned zis place to ze ground?

   ~~~Not really...
   
Harle:
   Ahh, oui?
   You are no fun.

Harle:
   Well, first of all to
   teach you all a lesson...
   And second of all to get rid
   of zat geezer who livez here.
   He iz an ally of ze Acacia
   Dragoonz, and I hear he'z
   quite skilled.
   I waz disappointed to see
   zat ze geezer izn't here.
   I wonder where he went?

Harle:
   And one more t'ing, Serge.
   Monsieur Lynx gave moi
   one more order.
   Zat iz to slow down
   your pursuit.
   
Harle:
   Here I go!
   
Harle:
   Listen, Serge...
   I know very well zat you
   do not want to fight moi,
   but...
   It would save mon honneur

Harle:

   ~~~Fine
   ~~~Not yet

Harle:
   Non!?
   Hurry up!

Harle:

   trés fort, Serge.

Harle:
   Well, zat'z all ze
   fun for today...!
   
Harle:
   Au revoir, Serge.
   
Old Man:
   Are you one of
   Lynx's minions?

Glenn:
   Radius, you are safe!
   
Radius:
   Hoh-hoh!
   Is that you, Glenn?
   It's been a while.
   You seem well.
   
Glenn:
   I am glad
   you are
   alright.
   
Radius:
   Yes...
   Miss Riddel had informed me
   that Lynx and the general
   were heading to Fort Dragonia.
   I played it safe and went
   into hiding for a while...
   And it looks like Lynx did
   pay me a visit.
   I'm sure the general has
   no idea what happened here.
   Lynx is the one behind all this.
   
Radius:
   I had a feeling
   something like this
   might happen...
   That is why I made
   sure to build a sturdy
   stronghold underground.
   I believe it should
   still be intact.
   
Glenn:
   Lynx must be
   plotting something.
   
Radius:
   By the way, Glenn...
   Who are these people?
   
Glenn:
   Oh... They are...
   
Radius:
   Well, no sense
   standing out here.
   Please, come in.
   
 [Haven, Hermit's Hideaway (Another)]
 
Radius:
   I see...
   So you have met
   Miss Riddel and Glenn.
 
Radius:
   Hmmm...
   I see.
   
Radius:
   Yes, I once wielded a sword
   as a proud member of the
   Acacia Dragoons.
   Glenn's father, Garai, the
   blacksmith, Zappa, and I used
   to tear up the battlefield.

Radius:
   But that was a good
   fifteen years ago...
   When Garai lost his life on
   the central continent, I vowed
   to become his sons' guardian.
   I officially retired four years
   ago, after Dario received his
   father's sword, the Einlanzer.
   I have been here ever since,
   living a carefree life away
   from the rest of the world.
   
Radius:
   However, Dario is
   no longer with us...
   Life is so unpredictable...

Radius:
   It was then that Lynx
   approached General Viper.
   He spoke of the legendary
   treasure, the Frozen Flame,
   which is able to heal all
   illnesses and fulfill any dreams.

Radius:
   I do not know what this
   man Lynx is plotting...
   But I believe General Viper
   intends to overthrow the
   nation of Porre with the power
   of this legendary flame.
   Porre is a nation governed by
   militarism and has brought on
   suffering to many people on
   the central continent of Zenan.
   Perhaps the general envisions
   a bright and peaceful world,
   much like Guardia was at one
   time...
   
Radius:
   Or...
   Is he planning to find
   the answer as to why we have
   continued to hurt and kill
   each other since antiquity...?

Radius:
   In any case, I no longer
   wish to involve myself
   in any conflicts.
   Besides, there is no way
   I would want to face
   General Viper in battle.
   Young one, should you
   plan to engage in battle
   with Lynx, beware...
   He is a fearsome man.

Radius:
   I suggest you rest here
   for the night and leave
   in the morning.
   There are many cursed
   spirits wandering the
   seas around here.
   Rumor has it, they attack
   ships and suck the souls
   out of humans...
   
Member:
   I've heard rumors
   about this accursed
   ghost ship...

Kid:
   What?
   A ghost ship?
   Hah! You tryin' to scare me!?
   Don't make me laugh.
   
Radius:

 [Grandma]

   alright, Skelly.
   I'm just so happy
   that you are back.
   It must have been
   very hard on you.
   Don't leave again,
   Skelly.

Skelly:
   Whimper...

 [Grandma]
   Ohh, don't cry so much.
   My clothes are going
   to get all wet.

Skelly:
   I'm not crying because
   I'm sad. I'm crying
   because I'm so happy.
   You always told me,
   '"Don't hold back tears
   of joy."'

 [Grandma]
   Skelly...
  
 [Grandma]
   Ahh, to have Skelly come

   The gods must have
   answered my prayers...
   Ohh, I thank the heavens
   with all my soul...
   
Skelly:

Member:
   Could this be...

Member:
   The ghost ship?
   
Member:
   Well, what are
   we waiting for?
   
Member:
   You're right...
   We won't be able to navigate
   our boat in this fog.
   
Serge:
   ???
   
Kid:
   Oi! Is this thing
   really a ghost ship...!?

Poshul:
   Thith doethn't rook
   rike a ghotht thhip to I...

Mojo:
   ......
   Is-om this really
   a ghoost ship...?

Leena:
   Doesn't seem like a
   ghost ship to me...

Skelly:
   I've never met
   a ghost before...

Pierre:
   Ah, oui?
   Is this really
   a ghost ship?

Nikki:
   Could this really be
   a ghost ship...?

Korcha:
   This ain'tCHA ordinary
   ghost ship...

Razzly:
   I've never been on a
   ghost ship before...
   I'm fairy scared...

Mel:
   Wow! So this is
   a ghost ship!?

Greco:
   Is this...
   a ghost ship,
   amigo...?

Guile:
   What is this...?

Glenn:
   So this is
   the infamous
   ghost ship...?

Macha:
   Is this whatCHA
   call a ghost ship?

Doc:
   I sense human activity
   aboard this ship...

Luccia:
   Is dis a ghost ship?
   ...Highly illogical.

NeoFio:
   Is this really a
   ghost ship?
   
 [Pirate]
   Make way for Cap'n Fargo...!
 
Fargo:
   Arg! Ya seem ta be a bit young
   for one of Lynx's subordinates.
   Well, who cares!?
 
Member:
   What do you
   want from us!?
   
Fargo:
   That's up ta you...

Fargo:
   But first thing's first...

Fargo:
   What is yer intention?
   
Member:
   ???
   
 [Pirate]
   Don't play stupid!
   We know you're tryin' ta
   get ta Mount Pyre!
   We saw General Viper's and
   Lynx's ships anchored nearby.
   Are ya tryin' ta deliver them
   a message? Is that it!?
   
Kid:
   That's a load of bull!
   We don't work for them!
   We're out to get 'em!
   Get in our way and I'll
   kick yer arse so hard,
   you'll kiss the moons!!!

Poshul:
   We're not playing thtupid.
   Me have no idea what
   you're talking about.

Mojo:
   What are-om you
   talking about?
   We're-om after them.

Leena:
   No, no, no, you're mistaken.
   We're actually after them.
   They're our enemy!
   E-N-E-M-Y!

Skelly:
   Whaddaya sayin', man!?
   Don't associate us with Lynx!
   He's our enemy and we need
   to find 'em!

Pierre:
   Non, non, non, non, non...
   You are very much mistaken.
   We are in pursuit of them.

Nikki:
   You surely don't believe
   that we are their allies?

Korcha:
   WhatCHA talkin' 'bout!?
   Since when are we on the
   same team as Lynx!?
   We're after them, OK!?

Razzly:
   Are we Lynx's
   messengers,
   Sergey?
   I thought they
   were our enemy?

Mel:
   No...
   We're not messengers.
   We're chasin' them.

Greco:
   Actually, we are in
   pursuit of them, amigo...

Guile:
   Sigh...
   That is untrue...

Glenn:
   You do not have
   the facts straight.
   We, too, are in hot pursuit
   of Lynx. Do not hinder our
   mission to Fort Dragonia.

Macha:
   Can'tCHA see you're
   wrong?
   We're after them!
   Leave us alone!

Doc:
   It appears that you
   are mistaken.
   We are after them...

Luccia:
   Sigh...
   Dis is vhy it is so difficult
   dealing vith imbeciles like you.

NeoFio:
   Ragweed!
   What are you talking about?
   We're out to get Lynx.
   We don't work phor him!
   
Fargo:
   Huh? Are ya serious?
   Explain yerselves.

Fargo:
   I see...
   So that explains why
   you're after Lynx.

Fargo:
   But...
   Don't ya know you're
   riskin' yer lives?
   Don't ya recognize
   the danger associated
   with Lynx?
   He's a monster...
   A cold-blooded monster...
   An incarnation of death...

Fargo:
   To be frank with ya,
   we've had our share of
   encounters with Lynx, too.
   But that was a long time ago...
   Ever since then, we've 
   had ta disguise ourselves
   as this ghost ship.

Fargo:
   So you're gonna face Lynx, eh...?
   That's easy to say, but...
   
Kid:
   Cut the crap and get
   to the point!!!

Poshul:
   Tho what'th your point?

Leena:
   But what...!?
   Huh!?

Razzly:
   What is it you're
   trying to say!?

Luccia:
   Speak your mind.
   
Member:
   What are you
   getting at?
   
Fargo:
   Arg!
   Bring out our
   you-know-what!
   
 [Pirate]
   Aye-aye, Cap'n Fargo!
   
Fargo:
   I just wanna see if you
   youngsters can match up
   to the likes of Lynx.
   Just makin' sure
   you're not all talk.

Fargo:
   Looks like they're ready.
   Let's see what you can do!
   
Fargo:
   Just loosenin' ya up!
   Time ta get serious!!!
   
Fargo:
   What?
   They're not worthy
   enough opponents for ya!?

Fargo:
   Polly!!!
   
 [Pirate]
   '"You land-lubbers.
    You're a waste of
    me time."'
   ...Is what he said.

Fargo:
   Arg! Are ya just
   playin' with me!?
   
Polly:
   Gya-Gya-Gya
   Gya-Gya-Gya-Gya-Gya-Gya
   Gya-Gya-Gya-Gya-Gya-Gya-Gya
   
 [Pirate]
   '"Not bad, mateys...
    We'll meet again."'
   ...Is what he said.

   Fargo:
   Arg...
   Stronger than I expected.
   You got me blood boilin'.

Fargo:

 [Battle]
 
Fargo:
   Jolly ho!

 [SS Invincible (Another)]
 
Fargo:

   But keep in mind,

   from jellyfish stingers.
   You lubbers will sleep
   for a while.
   
Fargo:
   Well, that's that!
   Arg! Stick these land-
   lubbers in the hold!
   
 [Hold, SS Invincible (Another)]
 
Member:
   Are you alright,
   Serge?
   You don't look so well.
   
Member:
   Be on your guard.
   There's something
   going on outside.
   
 [SS Invincible (Another)]
 
 [Pirate]
   Huaaah...
   Standing watch ain't easy...

   the fog today...?

   You can't even see

 [SS Invincible]
 
 [Pirate]
   Arg...
   Looks like you're alright.
   I thought you were goners
   when that monster went in.
   
Kid:
   Ya think the almighty
   Kid would go down
   that easy!?

Kid:
   Anyways, what the bloody
   hell is goin' on here!?

Poshul:

   against the likes of us!
   
Leena:
   So, what was that thing?
   What's going on?

Skelly:
   Nyak-nyak-nyak...!
   I'm the bone!

Skelly:
   Anyway, tell us
   what's goin' on here!

Pierre:
   Ahh la lah!
   Please, I am not a
   weakling like you...!

Pierre:
   Tell us what's
   going on here, oui?

Nikki:
   Heh...
   Easier than playing
   the bass.

Nikki:
   By the way, what's
   going on?

Korcha:
   Don'tCHA realize we're
   a cut above the rest?

Korcha:
   By the way, what's
   goin' on, here?

Razzly:
   Tee-hee!
   We are fairy,
   fairy strong!
   
Razzly:
   Excuse me, but what
   in Fairy Godmother's
   name is going on?

Mel:
   Can'tCHA tell
   we're strong!?
   It was a cinch!

Mel:
   But what's goin'
   on here?

Greco:
   We do not go down
   so easily, amigo.

Greco:
   By the way, what is
   happening here, amigo?

Guile:
   ...Did not even
   break a sweat.

Guile:
   Tell me...
   What is going on here?

Glenn:
   My dragoon training is
   a lot harder than that.

Glenn:
   Do tell me...
   What is happening
   here?

Macha:
   CHA-HA-HA!
   They're no match
   for us!

Macha:
   But what's goin'
   on here?
   Don'tCHA know?

Doc:
   That was not nearly
   sufficient to bring
   us down, dude.

Doc:
   By the way, what
   is your prognosis
   of this situation?

Luccia:
   My being here vill
   be pointless if
   ve are defeated.

Luccia:
   By the vay...
   Vot is going on here?

NeoFio:
   Ragweed!
   We're tougher
   than you phink!

NeoFio:
   But seriously!
   Please explain what

Member:
   We don't go down
   that easily.
   
 [Pirate]
   Arg... Sorry, but

 [SS Invincible]
 
   '"Key duty is a
    big responsibility!"'
 
 [Pirate]
   You wanna know who's

   Phew... Thanks for the help.
   Huh? Who are you?
   Oh yeah... You're the land-lubbers

   I guess it doesn't matter now.
   So, where do ya plan to go?
   
   A key?
   I have no idea
   who has it...
   
   Oh...
   You found the key.
   Good luck.
   
 [Room, SS Invincible]
 
 [Pirate]
   H-How'd you guys get out!?
   Get back in the hold!
   This sucker's mine!
   
   Tch...I could've taken
   that thing myself, you know...
   But thanks anyway.
   
   Huh? A key?
   Sorry...I don't have it.
   
   Just don't die out there.
   Good luck.

   Did ya find the key?
   Oh good.
   You should be able to make
   yer way to the deck with that.
   Please help out Cap'n Fargo.

   Uhhh... I'm on key duty, but
   with all this chaos, I...uhhh...
   gave it to the nearest matey
   around me.
   I was in such a panic, I don't
   quite remember who I gave it to.
   I'm sure he's downstairs...
   somewhere...

 [Pirate]
   By thunder!
   I can't believe this
   is happening!
   
   Ohhh man...
   This is backbreaking...

 [Pirate]
   Another way to get on deck is by
   going through the arsenal downstairs
   and making yer way up from the outside.

   You want me to repeat that?

Fargo:
   Looks like the sea's
   back to normal...

Fargo:
   You said you were headin'
   to Fort Dragonia to go after
   Viper and his men.

Fargo:
   Let me give ya
   some advice.

Fargo:
   Mount Pyre is a fiery hell.
   Without any protection against
   fire, you'll lose strength fast.
   I suggest ya go see the
   Water Dragon for his
   divine protection.

Fargo:
   Although I haven't heard
   much about him recently.
   I wonder if that dragon's

Fargo:
   Actually...
   I haven't heard much about
   the other dragons, either.

Fargo:
   And those monsters
   we just beat...
   What's goin' on nowadays...?

Fargo:
   ......
   I tell ya, even the sea seems
   ta have changed its nature...

Fargo:
   It's probably because
   we human folks have
   come around...
   
Kid:
   Yeah...yeah...
   I don't need this mushy
   talk from a pirate.

Poshul:
   It racks perthuathiveneth
   when thaid by a pirate.

Mojo:
   That's not-om something
   a pirate would say-om.

Leena:
   Hee... Didn't think pirates
   had a sentimental side.

Skelly:
   Why do I have ta hear
   this from a pirate...?

Pierre:
   Ahh la lah...
   I comprendre what you're saying,
   but coming from a pirate...

Nikki:
   ......
   Please...not from a pirate.

Korcha:
   Don'tCHA know you're a pirate?
   Why get all sentimental?

Razzly:
   Tee-hee!
   A pirate's getting sentimental!

Mel:
   Hey, mister, it just
   doesn't sound right
   comin' from a pirate.

Greco:
   That is not something a
   pirate would say, amigo...

Guile:
   You are a pirate,
   are you not?

Pip:
   I thought piwates didn't
   have a soft side?

Glenn:
   I never thought I
   would hear something
   like this from a pirate.

Macha:
   WhatCHA talkin' about?
   I thought you were a pirate?

Doc:
   Hah haha...
   That is quite interesting,
   coming from a pirate-dude.

Luccia:
   Vhy must I hear dis
   from a pirate?

NeoFio:
   ......
   Oh my... A pirate,
   getting all sentimental...

Fargo:
   In the name of Davy Jones...
   What have we done...?
   
Nikki:
   Do you...
   have any children?
   
Fargo:
   Huh?
   What kind of question
   is that...?
   
Fargo:
   Children, eh...?
   Yeah, I do.
   But it may be
   more appropriate
   to say I did...

Fargo:
   I had two children,
   but they both died...
   That was long, long ago...

Fargo:
   If my son were still
   alive today...
   why, he'd be 'bout
   yer age...
   
Nikki:
   I'm sorry...
   
Fargo:
   Hah!
   Don't worry 'bout it, matey.
   That was a long time ago.
   But...why do ya ask?
   
Nikki:
   I-It's nothing...
   I just felt like
   asking, that's all...
   
Fargo:
   ......
   Well, alright.
   Take care of yerself.
   
Fargo:
   Ahoy, mateys!
   Make yerselves at home.

Pip:

Member: 
   ...What's going on?
   Where's Kid...?
   Don't tell me she...

Member:
   Serge...
   It's not your fault...
   
Kid:
   ...What're you guys
   all doin' there?

Kid:
   Oi, it's been a while, eh?
   But what's with the astonished
   look on yer faces?

Kid:
   Huh, what?
   Where was I?
   Oh, I complained about this
   sissy gown, but then they hid
   me own clothes somewhere to
   stop me from tryin' to escape...

Kid:
   So I had no choice but to
   take a walk around the
   village lookin' like this.
   Anyway, what's up with you
   guys?
   Didja come back because you
   were worried about me?

Kid:
   Heh, I ain't gonna drop
   dead from such a weako
   poison like that...!
   But, I guess it was a
   pretty close call this
   time, eh...
   Hehe.
   
Member:
   But how did you
   neutralize the poison?

Kid:
   Sorry, I haven't the
   foggiest idea, either.
   The doc will be back
   this afternoon, so
   let's ask him then.

Doc:
   You are here to ask
   me how I was able to
   neutralize the poison?

Kid:
   ...Yeah.
   There's nothing to lose by
   knowing how, right Doc?

Doc:
   It was a coincidence...
   No, it was probably an
   act of fate.
   After you left the village,
   a young man came to visit me
   upon hearing of the patient's
   condition from a villager.
   He had brought a certain
   item with him.

Member:
   A certain item?
   You don't mean...?

Doc:
   Yes, it was Hydra Humour.
   He happened to have a vial
   of it with him at the time...

Kid:
   Hey doc, who was that guy?
   Do you at least know his name?

Doc:
   I am sorry.
   I do not know...
   He only told me that he
   '"came from the mainland."'

   Kid:
   ...Came from the mainland?
   Tsk! At least give me a chance
   to thank him! Sheeze!
   I hate being in debt to others!
   Ah, hell!
   When I find him I'll...!?
   Wait, that's not what I wanna do.

Doc:
   That is all that I know.
   In the end, I proved useless
   as a doctor.
   It is not something that
   could be forgiven, but I
   offer my apologies...

Kid:
   Hey, wait doc.
   What's with the formality?
   No matter what else
   happened, you're the one
   that made the antidote,
   right?
   It would've been useless
   without you, even if we did
   have the right stuff.

Doc:
   ...Thank you, Kid.

Kid:
   Oi, stop that.
   I'm the one that should be
   thankin' you.
   No worries, doc!
   Well, the only thing that bugs
   me is the guy that brought
   that...humour, was it?

Kid:
   Hehe... I guess I caused
   you blokes a heap of
   trouble, too!

Kid:
   Hey, don't worry.
   I'm no good at this...
   But thanks.

Doc:
   So, what are you dudes
   planning to do next?
   Do you intend to continue
   on your journey?

Kid:
   That's right, we've still got
   things to take care of.
   We'll be leaving by tomorrow.
   Serge has got a lot of
   problems that need to be
   solved...

Doc:
   Then will you allow me
   to join in your party?
   I would like to broaden my
   horizons as a doctor...
   Will I be too much of a
   nuisance to you?

Kid:
   Whoa, having a doctor with
   us will be a great help!
   Besides, how can I turn down
   a request from me lifesaver.
   We're more than happy to
   have you with us!


Doc:
   ...Thank you kindly.
   It has gotten late and
   I need to make preparations.
   It would probably be better
   if we leave tomorrow.
   Please rest here for the night.
   
Kid:
   ...I see.
   So that's what's been goin' on
   while I was snoozin' away here.
   You say Viper and his mob are
   headed for Fort Dragonia, heh?

Kid:
   Didja hear?
   Fort Dragonia's the oldest
   ruin that the Dragonians
   left on this planet.
   From what I hear, we
   need the '"Dragon Tear"'
   to activate the fort.

Kid:
   Don't ya remember, Serge?
   It's that blue orb that was on

   A blue orb...
   ~~~Was there such a thing?
   ~~~Yes, I remember
   
Kid:
   What, you don't remember?
   Gawd you're hopeless...

Kid:
   Great, so I don't have
   to waste me breath
   explaining it then...

Kid:
   If I ain't mistaken,
   that orb was probably
   the Dragon Tear.
   Which means that it's
   in the hands of old
   Viper right now.

Glenn:
   ...I cannot believe it!
   The general has the
   Dragon Tear... But why?

Member:
   Then General Viper
   plans to...

Kid:
   ...To activate the ruin.
   There's no doubt about that.
   In any case, we can't just
   sit back and let this happen.
   
Glenn:
   An impenetrable fortress
   surrounded by rough terrain...
   And I hear it is also sealed by
   the powers of the Dragonians.
   Is the general trying to stop
   the Porre military with it...?

Member:
   This must have something
   to do with the recent
   actions of Porre.
   A fortress surrounded
   by rough terrain and
   sealed by the powers of
   the Dragonians...
   Is the general
   going to start
   a war with Porre?

Kid:
   Even I don't know that,
   but I wouldn't say that
   it's not a possibility...
   
Member:
   Then we must head
   to Fort Dragonia.
   Unfortunately, Mount
   Pyre is a rugged
   obstacle that lies on
   the path to the fort.
   From what I've
   heard, the place is
   a fiery hell.
   Trying to cross
   the mountain
   unprepared will
   be hard going..

Member:
   Come to think of it...
   that captain said
   we should obtain
   the divine protection
   of the Water Dragon...
   
Member:
   But the water source
   of Water Dragon Isle
   has run dry.
   Even the fairies said
   that the Water Dragon
   is no longer in this
   w.orld...
   
Member:
   ...Does that mean we
   have to climb Mount Pyre
   on our own?

Member:
   Rumor has it, the water
   source has dried up
   due to abnormal weather...
   
Member:
   The chances of the 
   Water Dragon being on
   the island are slim...
   
Member:
   So, in the worst case,
   we have to climb
   Mount Pyre on our own?
   
Kid:
   Dragons, eh...?
   This is gettin' bigger
   by the minute.
   But I think this
   problem can be easily
   taken care of!

Member:
   What do you mean
   by that?
   
Kid:
   Serge, you
   hold the key
   to our problems.

   Kid:
   You heard the story from the
   village shaman, right?
   The story about the
   '"Land of Genesis."'

Member:
   Kid, are you
   talking about
   the other world...?
   the world where
   Serge
   came from?

Kid:
   Yeah, that's right.
   The situation in each
   world is different, right?
   Things missing in one world
   can be found in the other.
   If that's true, then we
   still stand a chance!

Member:
   But how are we
   going to get to
   the other world?

Kid:
   My amulet...
   
Member:
   Amulet?

Kid:
   Yeah, my Astral Amulet.
   It's the other key to
   solving our problem.

Kid:
   I don't know if you've heard from
   the shaman, but you need lots of
   power to cross the dimensions.
   She said it was something
   about the powers of hope
   and will.

Kid:
   According to the shaman,
   this amulet has that sort
   of power.
   Normally, I would've just
   thought she was crazy,
   but this time, maybe I
   oughta listen to her.

Kid:
   This amulet alone ain't
   enough to cross dimensions,
   though.
   We need the other key to make
   the connection between this
   world and the other world.

Member:
   A connection...
   So you're saying that
   Serge is this key?

Kid:
   According to the shaman,
   that's right...
   Someone that's not supposed
   to be in this world that's
   the link to a world that was
   severed 10 years ago...
   The missing piece of the puzzle.

Kid:
   That's the lowdown.
   The rest is up to you,
   Serge.
   We need to first get that
   '"divine protection"' or
   whatever from the
   Water Dragon.

Kid:
   Well, I don't know
   about you, but...
   I probably don't need
   no Dragon's protection
   to get me through hot
   water! But that's me...

Kid:
   We gotta head to the
   '"Land of Genesis."'
   The place where this all began!
   Only you know where that is.
   Before we go, I'll leave this
   in yer keeping for a while.
   But, don't ya dare lose it
   on me!

   Serge received the
   Astral Amulet.

Kid:
   Alright, let's go
   to the place where
   this all began!


   Kid joined your party!
   
Doc:
   There is still much
   to be learned in this world...
 
 [Assistant]
   Doctor, please come back
   to the clinic sometime.
   Serge, please look
   after the doctor for us.

   Be careful on the road.
   Hardship is a constant
   companion on a journey, but
   please keep your heads up...
   
 [Opassa Beach (Another)]
 
Member:
   So this is
   the dimensional
   gate...

Member:
   Then let's
   get going!
 
Kid:
   Opassa Beach...
   Yeah, so this is it...
   The point of contact, and
   the starting point...
   This is the '"Cross Point."'

Kid:
   What do you expect
   us to do now, mate?

Kid:
   An open seam to the world...
   A wormhole that
   traverses dimensions...
   The world's callin' you,
   Serge...
   Callin' the lost piece
   of the puzzle...

Kid:
   An open seam to the world...
   A dimensional wormhole...
   The world's callin' the lost
   piece of the puzzle...

 [Opassa Beach (Home)]

Kid:
   Hah!
   That was it!?

Kid:
   We're in that other
   world now, right?
   That wasn't such
   a big deal.
   
 [Arni (Home)]
 
 [Old Man]
   Uhhh...
   Ughhh......?

   Oh, it's you, Serge.
   Great day, huh?
   How's your day been?
   What was that...?
   You want me to take you
   to Water Dragon Isle?
   Well, it's not too far,
   so I'm willin' to take
   you there for 100G.

   ~~~Forget it
   ~~~Yes, take me!

   OK. Call on me
   anytime you want
   to get off the island.
   As you can see,
   I don't have much to do.
   Huaaaaaaaah...

   Hey, you don't have enough.
   I'm sorry but I can't
   take you there for free.

   Serge paid 100G.

   Great!
   Shall we get going?

   There we go.
 
 [Chapter]
On to Water Dragon Isle -
In search of the dragon blue...

 [Water Dragon Isle]
 
 [Old Man]
   Hoho, it's been a while since I
   visited this isle, but its beauty
   never fades.
   But there's something strange...
   I don't see any of the fairies that
   usually dance around the pond.

   Oh, pardon me.
   There's a small village of
   fairies on this isle.
   It should be just beyond this pond.
   I don't know what brings you to
   this isle, but it's best to ask the
   fairies to learn about the place.

   In the meantime, I'll be 'round
   here fishing.
   This pond is great for fishing.
   
   Going back to the village already?
   ~~~Not yet
   ~~~Head back

   Give me a holler when
   you're through.
   You got that, Serge?

   Okey-dokey,
   then let's head back,
   shall we?
   
   I know it's not that far, but
   going there and back is a lot
   of work for an old man like me.
   
   Ho, ho...oh, don't mind it.
   I'll just keep fishing as
   long as I'm here.

   Going back to the village already?
   ~~~Not yet
   ~~~Head back
   
Razzly:
   ......!?
   The village...
   Fairy-ville is...
   W-Why did this...
   Rosetta...
   everyone... No.
   No, it can't, it can't be...
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Hmph, just when I thought it was
   a rarity to see humans on this
   remote isle, you all hi-ho along.
   Look at this isle...
   It's beautiful, a perfect
   fit for our new home!
   Too good for these damn fairies.
   You humans taught us that the
   world is built on the dead bodies
   of other species...
   Now, hi-ho away with you...
   along with the fairies...
   to the deeps of the sea!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   What brings humans here?
   If you intend to intrude, you will
   not be given a warm welcome.
   This land is the new home of
   the dwarves...
   Humans are not welcome here.
   Begone with yourselves!!
   
 [Blue Fairy]
   Weep...
   They killed everyone...
   
   ...Razzly?
   It's Razzly...!
   You are alright?

Razzly:
   Uh-huh, I'm alright.
   ...Where is Rosetta?
  
 [Blue Fairy]
   The dwarves took her
   into the cavern...
   Quick, Razzly...
   Rosetta needs your help!
 
 [Dwarf]
   Hi-ho, how daring!
   You shall perish in the
   depths of the sea...
   along with those fairies,
   you filthy humans!
   
 [Gold Fairy]
   Hey, wake up...
   Please...answer me.
   Why...? Why, oh, why...?
   
   Razzly...
   You are alive. But, but,
   everyone...everyone else is...
   
 [Dwarf]
   Will you never understand!?
   You do not cherish the
   treasures of nature as we do.
   Begone with you!
   
 [Dwarf]
   You human bastards!
   You dare befoul our
   new lands, too!?
  
   get away with this.
   We have to save
   the fairies!

 [Water Dragon Isle Sanctum (Home)]
 
Dwarf Chieftain:
   I will not tolerate any humans
   trespassing beyond this point!
   Defy me and you will face the
   consequences!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Hmph, I knew you'd come.
   Now we must confront you fools
   once again...
   I suppose this is fate...
   This ends now...
   With your death!
   Die, human scum!!!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Hmph, if you don't want to
   end up like the fairies,
   begone from this land!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   If only you'd left peacefully,
   you wouldn't have to die.
   You don't stand a chance
   against us!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Grr... Such strength.
   It seems I've underestimated
   you humans...
   This will not happen a
   second time!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Try all you like, you'll
   never defeat us!
   We're not as weak as when
   you first defeated us!

Dwarf Chieftain:
   Krr... What strength.
   I can not allow our clan
   to be defeated here...
   Next, the next will be your last!
   Come after us, humans.
   If you want to save the fairies!

Dwarf Chieftain:
   You run from us, humans!?
   Are you not here to destroy us?
   Just as you did the forest...

Dwarf Chieftain:
   Retreat! Tallruf, Bearduf!
 
 [Dwarf]
   Nooo, this treasure is mine!
   I'm not giving it up!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Humans helping fairies?
   You surprise me!
   However, there is no way I can
   allow you to leave here alive.
   You will pay for not heeding our
   warnings...with your death!

Dwarf Chieftain:
   It's no use!
   There is no escape! Let's finish
   this once and for all!!!

Dwarf Chieftain:
   This is the heart of the cavern.
   You will not leave here alive...
   If you dare turn your backs
   against us, we will use you
   for target practice with this
   cannon!
   Our determination will not
   be shaken!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   I told you, we will not let you go.
   The shot we just fired is our
   prized Element cannon.
   Hehehe...causing '"physical
   disabilities"' is just one of
   its many features...
   If you wish, we can blow you to
   pieces!
   
Member:
   Urr, we can't get away
   from this one! This
   isn't good, Serge...
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Grrh, such strength...
   Are we to be driven off
   our land once again?
   Is there no land on this planet
   where we can live in peace?
   Oh, Goddess of Fate, why are we
   dealt such a hand...
   Are humans really the greatest
   species on this planet?
   These heretics of evolution,
   these destroyers of
   the planet...? Ugh...
   
Member:
   ..Serge.
   We're not
   finished yet.
   It's too early
   to go outside.
   
Member:
   Let's go, Serge.
   The Water Dragon is just
   beyond here...
   We've to finish what
   we came here for.
   
Member:
   Serge!
   There is a fairy
   over there...
   
   ...Serge.
   Is it alright?
   
Rosetta:
   Agh...who are...you?
   I will be fine. The other
   fairies, are they alright?
   
Member:
   I don't feel their
   presence in the caves
   anymore...
   I am sure it's safe
   outside as well.
   
Member:
   We're sorry,
   but wait right
   here for a minute...
   We need to go further
   into the cave.
   It will only be a 
   little while...
   
Rosetta:
   What is happening...
   to this island?
   ...agh!
 
 [If you got the Hydra Humour, this dialogue plays]
 
Dwarf Chieftain:
   So, you've made it this far,
   but you will not find us so easy
   to defeat!
   We will settle our scores here
   by avenging the extinct Hydra
   and our dying homeland
   with your death!
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Grrh, such strength...
   Are we to be driven off
   our land once again?
   Is there no land on this planet
   where we can live in peace?
   Oh, Goddess of Fate, why are we
   dealt such a hand...
   
Member:
   That forest is
   not yet dead.
   The Hydra is
   not yet extinct.
   She had a whelp, even though it
   was still only an infant.
   The forest is still alive
   and will continue to thrive.
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   A Hydra whelp!?
   There is still hope
   left in that forest...
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Still, you killed the Hydra.
   Nothing you do can change that.
   But passed time will not return.
   We, too, cannot advance
   forward, trapped by our past.

Dwarf Chieftain:
   We will return to the
   forest once again.
   Farewell, humans.
   We, too, have sinned.
   For this sin, we must make
   ammends for the rest of our
   lives...

Dwarf Chieftain:
   Some day...let us hope that we
   children of the planet can live
   together in peace...
   
   Razzly:
   ...!?
   S-Sis!
   Rosetta!

Member:
   ...Razzly.
   Is she your
   big sister?
   
Rosetta:
   ...Ooo, is that you,
   Razzly...?
   You were alright...
   
Razzly:
   Yes, yes...
   It's me, sis.
   ...It's Razzly.
   I've finally made it home.
   But...but...
   the village, everyone's...
   
Rosetta:
   Why are there...humans
   on this island?
   Razzly, did these people
   bring you back here?

Razzly:
   Yes, they found me
   in the forest. If it wasn't
   for them, I would've been...

Rosetta:
   So, these people saved you...
   Ow, agh...

Razzly:
   !? Sis, it's alright!
   Please, hold on to yourself.
   I'll be here with you...

Razzly:
   I'm fairy sorry, Serge..
   Let me stay with Rosetta
   for a little while...

Rosetta:
   Are you the ones,
   ...that rescued my sister,
   Razzly?
 
 [If she dies]

Razzly:
   No, no...
   This can't be! Rosetta!
   Answer me, please!!!
   
Member:
   ...!?
   Tsk, if only we had gotten
   here a little earlier...
 
   It's already passed away.
   
Member:
   Wait, Serge.
   We've come so far,
   we can't turn back now.

Member:
   Serge, there's
   something that looks
   like a monument back there.
   That must be
   what we're
   looking for.

   It is but a trifle for we

   Take this, son of man.

 [Fairy]
   They said that they
   '"were chased out of the
   forest by the humans."'
   And they drifted
   down to our island...
   so the humans are to blame!!!
 
 [Fairy]
   Because of you humans, our village,
   our friends have been made victims!!!
   Why can't humans live in harmony
   with nature? Why do you continue
   to act the way you do?
   Don't you see what the outcome of
   your choices will be in the future!?
 
 [Fairy]
   Razzly, you're a fairy,
   so come back to us!
   You don't have to be with
   those humans!

Razzly:
   Sorry...
   I can't return to the village.
   I'm still a part of the fairies...
   But...but...
   I'm also friends with Serge.
   and the others, too. I can't
   betray them and go back yet!
   
Razzly:
   Sis, forgive me.
   I'm leaving this island...
   We've caused so much trouble
   for everybody... There's no
   way I can stay here now.
 
Rosetta:
   Wait...

Rosetta:
   Give this to Razzly...

 [Fairy]
   This is from Rosetta to you...
   Take it with you...
 
   Wisp Cape.
   
Rosetta:
   This island is your home,
   now and forever.
   When you have sorted out your
   feelings, come back to us.
   Your big sis will always be
   waiting for you on this island...
   
Razzly:
   Sis...

Rosetta:
   Dear sirs, please look after
   my sister...
   Although it is a hard farewell
   now, time shall heal the pains
   of our wounded hearts.
 
 [If Rosetta died]
 
Razzly:
   Sis...everybody...
   I'm sorry all this happened
   because of us...
   
   are you really going?

Razzly:
   ...Yes.
   Please take care of
   Rosetta...
   Please bury her on Moon Isle...
   so that she may forever watch
   over us from above...
   I am leaving this
   island for a while.
   But I will return some day.
   Until then, goodbye...
   
 [If you didn't save Kid]
 
 [Fairy]
   Why, why...
   You crooks, I hate all you
   wicked humans!! Hurry up and
   get off this island!

Rosetta:
   A very sad tragedy, triggered
   by the acts of humans.
   We have lost so many of our
   people and loved ones.
   Although our village has been
   saved, no one here thinks
   kindly of man...
   I am extremely sorry,
   but please leave the island
   as soon as you can...
   
 [Night]
 
Kid:
   ...Where am I?
   I fainted, eh?

Kid:
   Sorry...
   Did I wake you up?
   I had a bad dream.

Kid:
   Seein' that fairy's eyes
   filled with tears over
   losin' her friends...
   That must've triggered
   memories of me own past.

Kid:
   I was an orphan...
   I was abandoned
   when I was a baby...

Kid:
   There was someone who took
   me in and raised me as if I
   were her own little sister...
   I'm alive here today
   thanks to her.

Kid:
   There were a lot of others
   like me at Sis's place,
   and...
   she was always makin'
   strange stuff...
   We didn't have money,
   but we were all happy.

Kid:
   Up until that Lynx bastard...
   came and shattered our
   happiness to pieces!
   Lynx raided our house,
   burned it down, and
   kidnapped Sis!
   
Kid:
   Sister...
   never came back...
   
Kid:
   Since then, I've wandered
   the world and experienced so
   much pain, just to get by...
   No one was there to help me.
   I was always alone.
   If you ask me, the idea of
   guardian angels watchin'
   over us all the time...
   that's a load of rubbish.
   
Kid:
   In this world, the underhanded
   always gets the last laugh.
   Only the ones who don't think
   anything of hurtin' others
   are the ones who get blood-
   stained fortunes.
   The ones who kill,
   the ones who devour,
   they're the ones who survive.
   That's the only rule
   of this world.
   
Kid:
   The great species of mankind...
   our wonderful world,
   filled with love and happiness...
   HA!
   Don't make me laugh!
   
Kid:
   But if that's how it is,
   that's fine with me.
   As long as I'm alive,
   there ain't no goin' back.
   I'll abide by this world's
   rules, and do what I gotta
   do, despite the rotten hand
   of cards I've been dealt!
   
Kid:
   I'll make sure that bloody
   bastard pays for what he's
   done!!!
   I will get even...!
   No matter what it takes!!!

Member:
   Huh?
   What's going on?
   The old boatman's gone!
   
Member:
   Did he head back to
   the village because
   we were so late?
   
 [Old Man]
   I figured you'd be coming
   back, so I set the boat out.
   Are you all safe?

   Oh, many pardons.
   It didn't look like you'd be coming
   back before sunset, and I had to
   return before it got dark.

   Well, since you made it back here,
   I guess you did what you needed to do?
   ...But you guys look a little gloomy
   for it to have gone well...
   
   No second thoughts?
   Then let's head back to the village.
   ~~~Can't go back yet
   ~~~Let's head back to the village

   Then I guess I'll wait
   here a little longer...

   ...You sure?
   Then let's go back to the village.

Rosetta:
   Please take care of Razzly.
   Do be careful...

[Acacia Dragoon]
   Our orders were to
   stand guard, but Glenn
   went off on his own.
   
   Huh?
   Glenn!!!
   What are you doing!?
   
Glenn:
   I will be accompanying
   these people for an
   extended period.
   
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Hmmm...
   Well, fine...
   Good luck.
 
 [Doc's Clinic, Guldove (Another) - If you didn't pick her up]
 
Doc:
   ...Hola, dudes.
   Did you come back to
   see the patient again?

Doc:
   I am sorry, but you are too late.
   She is no longer in the village.
   She has gone on alone.

Member:
   Gone on alone...?
   Do you mean that Kid
   has died...!?

Doc:
   Whoa, whoa, do not
   jump to conclusions.
   She is alive and well!
   The poison has been
   completely neutralized.
   
Member:
   ...What?
   So Kid's alright?

Doc:
   Shortly after you left, a young
   traveler who happened to have
   Hydra Humour visited the village.
   Thanks to him, we were
   able to save her life...
   After the poisoning
   was neutralized,
   she waited a few
   days for you.

Doc:
   But it appears it wasn't
   in her nature to wait.
   She left a few days ago
   on a merchant ship that
   stopped by the village.

Member:
   I see...Kid has
   recovered safely.

Doc:
   Yes, she is indeed healthy.
   I believe I told you this
   before, but the tides in
   the El Nido seas are tough
   to cross.
   Unless you are on a large
   vessel, it is impossible to
   leave the El Nido Archipelago.
   You will probably run into her
   again somewhere in El Nido.
   
Doc:
   She was searching for someone.
   Who she sought, I do not know...
   But since you were traveling
   with her, maybe you know who
   she was looking for?

Doc:
   That is all that I can say.
   Good luck and try not to
   take too many risks.

Solt:
   AHHHHHH!
   They're really here!
 
Peppor:
   Th-This time, let's shake
   it to them for sure!
   
Solt:
   Y-Yes.
   I'll do my best, Peppor!
   
Peppor:
   Let's shake it.
   
Peppor:
   Get ready...!
   
Solt:
   To shake it...!
   As Peppor would say.
   
 [Battle]
 
Solt:
   This time we shall not be beaten!
   I shall blow them to pieces with
   one of those powerfully powerful
   Elements you bought me, Peppor!

Peppor:
   You mean one of those
   \'"\Summoning Elements?\"'\
   Now we're shaking!

Solt:
   How tragically tragic!!!
   I hate to tell you this
   Peppor, but...
   I just remembered that I
   lost the Summoning Element
   I had with me!

Peppor:
   ......!?
   What do you mean, you \'"\lost\"'\ it?
   Don't tell me you dropped it or
   your dog ate it or some other
   stupid excuse like that!
   You're asking for a darn
   good shaking if you do!

Solt:
   No...I'm not that stupidly
   stupid, you know, Peppor!
   Actually, if you must know...
   that centipede monster in the
   Hydra Marshes stole it from me!
   And I was enjoying that
   excitingly exciting expedition
   in the marshes up till then, too...!

Peppor:
   What do you mean, a centipede
   monster stole your Element???
   What, he snuck up behind you and
   picked all your pockets with his
   hundreds of legs or something...?

Solt:
   No Peppor...
   When I say stole, I don't
   mean he picked my pockets
   or anything like that!
   I mean he took it from me by
   laying a \'"\Trap Element\"'\ in
   which my Element got caught!

Peppor:
   What in spice's name are
   you talking about?
   Would you kindly
   explain to me what a
   shaking Trap Element is.

Solt:
   Well...
   Errrh...
   It's difficultly difficult to
   explain in words, Peppor, so I
   will give you a demonstration...
   I will lay a Trap in front of
   you, Peppor, and then get you to
   use one of your special Elements.

Peppor:
   Alright.
   Let's give it a go...

Solt:
   10-4, Peppor!

Solt:
   Now, you see how I took your
   Element there, Peppor?
   I used a Trap Element
   designed exclusively to
   capture \'"\BlackHole\"'\ Elements!
   You see...each Trap Element
   only works on one kind of
   Element.
   They can't capture any
   Elements other than the ones
   they were designed to capture!

Peppor:
   Shaking!
   Hmmm...
   I see what you mean about
   having your Summoning
   Element stolen there...
   Alright, now I understand.
   So you can give me back my
   BlackHole Element now!

Solt:
   Oops!
   I should have told you.
   I can't give it back to you.
   You can't get that Element
   back again unless another
   monster is silly enough to
   have its Element captured...
 
Peppor:
   Huh......?
   Well, I guess it doesn't matter,
   seeing as you've got your hands
   on it now...
   So...why don't you hurry on up
   and use that Element you just
   trapped on the enemy!
   Come on...
   what are you waiting for...?
   Huh......?
   
Solt:
   You know you can't use an
   Element until you have
   equipped it properly!
   So we'll have to wait
   until after this battle
   is over before we can
   re-equip it and use it!
   ......
   Oops!

Peppor:
   ...W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-
   W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-
   WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY!?!
   WHY THE HELL DO YOU ALWAYS
   HAVE TO BE SO DAMNED STUPID?
   THAT DOES IT!!!
   YOU'RE IN FOR A REAL
   SHAKING NOW!

Solt:
   Aaaaah!
   I'm sorrily sorry, Peppor!
   Please don't hit me...
   too hard!
   
 [Mount Pyre (Another)]
 
Solt:
   They ran away, Peppor!
 
Peppor:
   O-Our day of victory
   has finally come.
   
Solt:
   Our days of disgracingly
   disgrace and
   shamefully shame
   are finally over!
   
Peppor:
   R-Right.
   It's time for us to
   shake our days of glory!
   
Peppor:
   Yeah?
   We'll just give you
   another quick shake down!
   
Solt:
   That's right, Peppor!
   
Peppor:
   S-Shake it outta here!!!

Solt:
   P-Peppoooooor!

   need to get through.
   I need to see...
   I need to see for myself
   what is happening!

   leaving the dragoons...
   
Karsh:
   HAH!
   You call yourself
   a dragoon!?
   
Karsh:
   Luccia, what
   the hell are
   you doin' here?
   
Luccia:
   Being a dragoon is no
   concern of mine.
   I only act according to
   my own personal motives.
   You understand?

Luccia:
   I only act according to
   my own personal motives.
   You understand?

Karsh:
   Hah! Yeah, I'm sure.
   You are a selfish one.
   
Karsh:
   HAH!? Sure, yeah,

   You are a selfish one.

   You're more trouble
   than I thought...
   But do you really
   think your skills are
   superior to mine?

Kid:
   Sore loser!!!
   
Lynx:
   Serge, have you ever
   questioned who you really are?

Kid:
   Serge...!?

Lynx:
   What has been the significance
   of your existence up until now?
   On that ominous day 10 years
   ago, the boundary of space and
   time was torn, and part of me,
   in fact, died...
   
Lynx:
   You cannot defeat me,
   Serge...
   This is because denying me
   is the same as erasing
   your very existence.

Kid:
   Don't be taken in by
   his rubbish, Serge!!!
   This guy's full of it!

Lynx:
   Huh...
   We'll see about that.
   There are two sides
   to every coin.
   Life and death......
   Love and hate......
   They are all the same.

Kid:
   What'd you say!?
   Talk some sense, will ya!

Kid:
   Serge!
   What's wrong!?
   
Kid:
   LYNX!!!
   What have you
   done to Serge!?

Kid:
   Serge!
   You alright!?

Serge:
   Yes...
   I'm fine...
   I'm just fine,
   Kid.

Serge:
   What are you doing,
   Lynx?
   Now's your chance,
   Kid!
   Kill him!!!

Kid:
   Yeah...
   I know.

Kid:
   This is the end of
   you, Lynx!!!
   Say yer prayers!

Kid:
   There's no escape,
   Lynx!!!
   
Serge:
   You did it,
   Kid.

Kid:
   Y-Yeah...

Kid:
   Y-Yeah...
   I showed him...

Serge:
   Now finish him.
   What's wrong?
   Settle it once
   and for all.

Kid:
   ......

Serge:
   Here, hand me your dagger.
   I'll finish him off.

Serge:
   Kid, you're injured...
   Here, hand me your dagger.
   I'll finish him off.

Serge:
   Watch this, Kid...
   I'll avenge Lucca for you!
   Die, LYNX!

Kid:
   WAIT!!!

Serge:
   What, Kid?
   He's your foe,
   isn't he?

Kid:
   ......
   How do you know
   Lucca's name?

Serge:
   ......?
   What are you talking
   about, Kid...?

Kid:
   Not once did I ever
   mention Lucca's name
   to you, Serge...

Serge:
   ......!!!

Kid:
   No...
   Don't tell me you're...!?
   
Member:
   Serge...
   Why...!?

Serge:
   QUIET!!!

Serge:
   You, too!!!

Member:
   ......!?
   N-Noooooo...!

Serge:
   This is the end of the
   road for you, Kid.

Kid:
   U-Ugh...!
   Y-You're Lynx...
   ain't ya!?

Lynx:
   Heh heh heh...!
   I'll send you
   to see Lucca.

Lynx:
   I'll finish
   you off later.

Lynx:
   Look at yourself,
   Serge...
   I mean, Lynx!
   Heh heh heh...
   Excellent!
   The enmity is growing!
   The only thing pure in
   this world is enmity!
   Well then, the time has
   come for the curtain to fall.
   Your services are no
   longer needed.
   Even your very existence
   is worthless...
   Farewell, Serge.
   
Lynx:
   Finally, I have the key.
   The key to the gate of Fate!
   The time has finally come for
   the Frozen Flame to awaken!!!

Lynx:
   Come to the Sea of Eden,
   Serge...
   Should you wish to end
   your dream of 10 years ago...

   Now, let love bleed!
   Darker and deeper
   than the seas of hell!

   'ow many yearz has it been

   wandered into this world...?
   Very strange indeed...

   Rightly so, the world

   I have a feelin' I can
   get outta 'ere if I
   tag along.
   Besides, ya won't be
   able to make it inside
   that tower alone.
   I'll open it for ya.
 
   
Harle:
   You are très late, non?
   Come on, Monsieur Lynx,
   let'z go.
   We don't have ze time
   to be dawdling here.
   We may truly get
   lost in time.
   I can't afford to
   lose you just yet.

   ~~~I'm not Lynx...!
   ~~~Am I Lynx...?

Harle:
   You are no longuer
   Serge.
   You are Monsieur Lynx.

Harle:
   Exactement.
   You are now Monsieur Lynx.
   You are no longuer Serge.

Harle:
   Allons, regarde-toi!
   Just look at yourself...
   Who in zeir right mind
   iz going to believe you
   are Serge?
   C'est simple.
   If everybody, except for
   yourself, sayz zat you
   are Monsieur Lynx...zen...
   
Harle:
   Voilà!
   You are Monsieur Lynx!
   It'z az simple az zat.
   Zat iz who you are!
   C'est la réalité!
   If you try and go against
   réalité...
   Réalité will surely
   crush you.
   Réalité will kill you.
   And réalité will continue
   to go on az if not'ing
   ever happened...
   From yesterday to today,
   and from today to tomorrow.
   Réalité marchez on...
   Leaving your crushed
   body behind...

   ~~~But I'm Serge!
   ~~~I'm...Lynx...?

Harle:
   Ooh la lah...
   So, you still insist zat
   you are Serge, oui?

Harle:
   Bravo, c'est exact.
   You are Monsieur Lynx...

Harle:
   Regarding your mémoire
   az zis Serge...
   You may be able to rewrite it
   if you use ze Dragon Tear.

Harle:
   In réalité, you died
   10 yearz ago in ze
   other world.
   How can you say for sure
   zis iz ze real you?

Harle:
   Maybe for you it
   is évident, but...
   I wonder if you ever
   really were Serge...?

Harle:
   Furthermore...
   what waz zis Serge?
   A figure, a shape?
   A spirit?
   A soul?
   Where waz zis Serge?
   
Serge:
   Who am...
   I?
   Who are...
   you?
   You're not me.
   I'm not you.
   I am reality...
   You are...
   
Sprigg:
   Now, open the door
   to reality only.
   One mistake, and you'll
   never make it back
   to the real world.
 
Harle:
   How boring...
   Fine, I understand
   how you feel.
   Let'z head back to
   reality.
   
   
 [Hydra Marshes (Home)]
 
Harle:
   We are back to réalité.
   Doez zis place look familiar
   to you, Monsieur Lynx?
   Do you need moi to tell
   you where we are?
   ~~~No, I already know
   ~~~Yes, tell me

Harle:
   Ahhh, you remember.
   Then let'z leave zis
   forest marshez at once.

Harle:

   We are very close to your home.
   We are in ze Hydra Marshes.
   You remember now, non?
   Although I do not know if

Sprigg:
   ...Ahhh...yes...
   I'm finally back in

Sprigg:
   Ahhh...
   A world with substance...
   Even the water and
   air is different!
   This is great!

Sprigg:
   It's time to pahr-tay!
   Let's have a toast to our
   return into the real world!
   
Harle:
   Listen, old lady... You are
   not getting any younger.
   Try to control your emotionz.
   And zere iz absolument no
   time to be partying!
   We must hurry along.

Sprigg:
   Wot's your problem, lass?
   It's been yearz since I've
   been back to the real world.
   You sure are a buzz-kill.
   ...So anyway, where to now?

Harle:
   Ooh, Monsieur Lynx...
   You seem worried about
   zat Serge character.
   Do you still remember?
   Ze place where it all started...
   '"Where Angelz Lose Zeir Way"'...

Sprigg:
   Where Angels......... WHATEVER!
   It has a bad ring to it.
   So wot exactly is it?
   
Harle:
   A gate to anodder world......
   Somet'ing like zat.

Sprigg:
   Wot!? Are you sayin'
   there's another dimensional
   distortion in this world!?
   Hya-hya-hyah!
   Very interestin', indeed!
   So, where is this place?

Harle:

   Let'z just get going! But first,
   we must leave zis forest.

Leena:
   I'm sorry, but

   How am I supposed to
   believe you're Serge
   when you look like that...?
   I'm sorry.

Leena:
   I still don't
   believe you.
   You can't just show up

   You're full of it!

Harle:
   Well...?
   What shall you do,
   Monsieur Lynx?
   Nobody in your village
   believez zat
   you are Serge.

Una:
   Of course we
   don't believe you!
   Everyone in this village
   knows Sergey! We're not
   gonna be fooled by a bunch
   of demi-humans like you!
   I don't know what you
   jokers are up to, but just
   get the hell outta our village!

Una:
   Everyone in our village
   knows Sergey!
   We're not falling for
   your tricks, demi-humans!
   Now pack your bags and
   get the hell outta here!
   
   Yeah!
   You're just trying to

   Well, it won't work!

   You can't fool us!

   May I help you?
   
Marge:
   What...?
   What did you just say...!?
   You're Serge...?
   
Marge:
   ......
   Please explain to me exactly
   what is going on here...
   
Marge:
   ......
   I see... So that man told
   you to go to the Sea of Eden.
   
   I really don't know about
   dimensional distortions or
   about the other world.
   But if, like you say,
   something big is really
   on the verge of happening...
   It may have all started
   14 years ago...
   On the night of the storm...
   
 [Flashback]
 
 [Marge]
   That night, your father, Wazuki,
   and his friend Miguel set out
   to sea, despite a storm...
   It was an emergency...

   They were swallowed by the high
   waves and lost consciousness.
   When they came to, they found
   themselves inside the Dead Sea...

   A place where no living creature
   dares enter. I don't know what
   he saw or what happened, but
   that incident changed your father.
   And your father's friend, Miguel...
   That was Leena's father.
   He never returned...

   Back then, that place
   wasn't called
   the Dead Sea...
   Yes, I believe they called it
   the '"Sea of Eden"'...
   That was 14 years ago.

Radius:

   Are you Lynx!?
   You're still alive...!?
   
Radius:
   Step outside,
   Lynx!
   For I, too, was once a
   valiant member of the
   Acacia Dragoons!
   I must put a stop to you!
   
Harle:
   Lah-la-la...
   Geezer, I wouldn't
   show off like zat.
   Zat iz if you want
   to live...
   Do not underestimate
   ze power of Monsieur Lynx.

 [Serge's House, Arni (Home)]
 
Radius:
   Hmmm...!?
   I do not sense any
   malice in your attacks...
   
Radius:
   Do you really mean
   to tell me that
   you are not Lynx?
   And is it true that the
   general is still active
   in the other world...?

Radius:
   Here, the general
   has been missing for
   the past 3 years now...

Radius:
   Understood!
   I shall accompany you!
   We may still have a chance
   to save the general and
   Riddel in the other world.

Harle:
   Zut! This geezer
   iz only going to
   get in ze way...

   
Radius:
   First, we must
   head to Termina...
   and gather news about
   General Viper's
   disappearance from
   this world.
   Don't worry, we will
   find a clue to return
   to the other world.

Radius:
   We must gather news in
   Termina, about General
   Viper's disappearance.
   We may find clues to
   show us how to return
   to the other world.
   I, Radius, shall give
   it my all, in the name
   of General Viper!
   
Marge:
   There are people out there
   who won't judge you
   by your appearance.

   and do your best.

   Mushroom!

   Whoa...!
   This is a rare mushroom
   found only in Guardia...!
   Or so it seems.

   Your mushroom for my treasure?

Mojo:
   As I recall-om,
   oover ten years ago....
   We brothers were-om stitched
   in a faraway land. We were then
   handed-om around the world,
   regardless of our own will.
   Some were burned-om,
   some were nailed-om...
   Our numbers decreased
   gradually, one by one.
   Out of our brothers, o.nly
   my big brother and I survived
   to reach-om this land...
   We were then separated-om,
   but I never stopped wondering
   what big brother might-om be
   doing now...

Mojo:
   Boogum?  The great swordsman
   Dario practiced his sword
   using brother as-om target...?
   Big brother, how honorable-om
   of you... The countless scars
   tell-om all.  I'm so. proud-om to
   be your brother...
   On the other hand, look-om at
   me with a nail stuck-om in my
   chest. I carry-om the hatred
   of countless people.
   Big brother, why were we
   born-om into this world?
   Every time I think-om, this
   nail starts to hurt-om.
   But, the answer must-om be 
   somewhere out there in 
   this world.
   I'm going to search-om for
   that answer, in place of
   my brother who's found-om his
   place to settle.
   Big brother, I hoope you'll be
   able to groow-om your roots
   into the earth and bloom
   beautiful flowers someday!

Van:
   At least knock
   before you enter!
   
Van:
   Are you guys tourists?
   If you want, I'd be willing
   to guide you around.
   Of course, there's a
   small fee involved.
   I think it's a bargain.
   How about it?
   ~~~Hire him
   ~~~Don't hire him

Van:
   Is that so?
   Oh well, it's your loss.
   
Van:
   You got it!

Gogh:
   Th-That is...!

Van:
   Huh!?
   
 [Landlady]
   You've had long enough
   to pay your debts and I'm
   not going to wait any longer.
   Either you pay up now,
   or I'll have you move
   out of this house...!

Gogh:
   But what will happen
   to my son and me...

 [Landlady]
   That's none of my
   concern.
   I just want to make
   this place into my personal
   storage for my precious
   treasures!

Van:
   Hey, wait!
   I'll pay that debt!

 [Landlady]
   Well, this is amusing.
   How is our little
   Mr. Van today?
   How much have you
   saved from your
   allowance?
   
Van:
   None of your business!
   This is what I got!
   
 [Landlady]
   Ha ha ha!
   This won't even pay
   off the interest.
   Better luck next time!

Van:
   Tsk!
   Just wait a little
   bit more!
   Then I'll be able
   to get the money 
   you need!

 [Landlady]
   What are you planning to do
   little Van? Don't waste
   your energy on something
   stupid.

Van:
   I'm going with these
   guys to search for the
   Frozen Flame!
   So, please!
   Wait just a little longer!

 [Landlady]
   Ahahaha!
   Just listen to you!
   You're pretty bright,
   but you're still just
   a kid!
   It's so naive of you
   to believe in such a
   fairy tale like the
   Frozen Flame.

   Of course it's a joke,
   isn't it?
   ~~~No, we're serious
   ~~~It's a joke, of course

Van:
   (Please, play along with me!!!)
   ~~~Help Van
   ~~~Never heard of it

 [Landlady]
   Amazing.
   You actually believe
   that legend...?
   Are you people crazy
   or something?

   Hahaha...
   Not a bad joke, though.
   The Frozen Flame is supposed to be
   the treasure of all treasures...
   Even if it's just a legend, there's 
   something very tempting about it.

   Alright.
   I will wait a little longer.
   Have the Frozen Flame ready
   by the time I come back here.
   Be careful not to burn yourself.
   Although you'll probably
   never find it.
   Hahahaha!

Van:
   Humph, how arrogant of her to
   push us around just because
   we're poor...
   If only we had money,
   if only we had money,
   this never would've happened...

Gogh:
   Hey, hey, Van.
   None of that.
   Besides, even though we
   don't have money...

Van:
   I don't want to hear that from
   you, dad! Where are we going
   to live as of tomorrow!?
   We're out of money because
   we're not selling any of the
   paintings we have in this room!

Gogh:
   I'm sorry Van...
   These pictures are just not
   good enough to sell yet.
   I only want to sell pieces
   that I'm satisfied with to those
   who understand my work...

Van:
   Fine...
   Then I'm going to have
   to be the one to find us
   a place to live...
   
   Van:
   Do you enjoy watching
   family disputes?
   There's absolutely, positively
   nothing here, so there's no
   point hanging around.
   
Van:
   Thanks...

   Thank you for
   going along with
   my bogus story...
   
Van:
   Hmm, I think it's a
   pretty good picture...
   So, why doesn't it sell?
   Dad isn't too active about
   selling his work. He says cocky
   things like he'll only sell to
   those who understand his work.
   Oh well...
   I guess I'll have to come up
   with the money myself.

Van:
   OK, let's see.
   My piggy bank is...
   Yup, it's here.
   
Van:
   OK, the money's in here, too.
   Now, the hardest part is
   finding a place to live.

Van:
   Next we have...

Van:
   Dad's homemade paint color,
   El Nido Blue.

Van:
   Painting the sea in this
   color gives it the smell
   of salt water...supposedly.
   If I were dad, I would've sold
   this paint by itself and
   made a fortune off it.

Van:
   This seashell...

Van:
   Mom...
   The only remaining
   reminder between me
   and mom is this shell.

Van:
   Tsk,
   it's cracked. I can't even
   hear the sound of the sea.
   But I...
   I remember it all...
   Mom found this shell and
   held it gently to my ear.
   And I remember that sound...
   that sound of the sea...

Van:
   I also had a fit, because
   I couldn't take home the sand
   castle I made that day.

Van:
   And now, we have to
   move outta the house
   mom and I lived in...
   But don't worry, mom.
   I'll take good care of
   dad for you.
   
Gogh:
   Van always had a hard time
   dealing with our troubles...
   Ever since he was a child,
   I made him do without so
   many things that he's
   grown a bit sarcastic.
   Yet, he is very kind at heart,
   like his mother always was.
   One day, I wish I could let
   him do as he pleases, just
   like other children...

Van:
   You guys are still here?
   You need something?
   Or are you here to buy
   my dad's paintings?

Member:
   Actually what you
   were just saying...

Member:
   We really are
   looking for
   the Frozen Flame...
   
Van:
   Huh?
   If you're being sarcastic,
   you got me pretty ticked!
   Oh, I get it.
   Are you trying to cheer
   me up or something?
   Don't underestimate me
   because I'm a kid!
   I know that no such
   thing exists in this world.
   Or are you all some kind of
   simpletons?
   
Member:
   Whether you believe it
   or not is up to you.
   
Van:
   ...Stop looking at me
   like that.
   You remind me of my mom.
   Your eyes tell me that
   you're telling the truth.
   Even I can see that.
   But I can't do it.
   I just can't leave my dad here
   and go off on some fool's
   errand, although it's tempting...

Gogh:
   I'll be alright, Van...
   You don't have to find
   any Frozen Flame or
   anything.
   I just want you to go
   out into the world and
   broaden your horizons.
   Of all the people in the
   world, only a handful
   live in happiness...
   No, maybe even those
   who look happy aren't
   really happy at all...
   I want you to go find
   out for yourself what
   real happiness means.
   So, go...

Van:
   Dad...

Gogh:
   Van...

Van:
   Just be careful to lock
   up at night...
   It'd be bad if any of the
   paintings were stolen...

Gogh:
   I will...
   Be careful out there.
   Oh yes...
   Wait just a moment.

Gogh:
   Take this with you.

Van:
   This is...
   a boomerang!?
   Dad, I'm not going
   out there to play!
   What am I going to
   do with this toy...?

Gogh:
   This isn't a toy.
   During your journey,
   there will be danger.
   This should help you
   when that time comes.
   And...a boomerang comes
   back when it is thrown.
   I want it to be a reminder
   to you.

Van:
   ......
   So it's a good
   luck charm, huh?
   Humph, I don't care for
   such things, but oh
   well. I'll take it
   with me, just in case.

Van:
   Alright...
   We gotta go before
   she comes back again!

   
Van:
   You need my help?
   I thought so.
   You guys probably
   couldn't even find a
   decent place to shop
   around here, right?
 
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No

Van:
   There's [Amount] G inside.

Van:
   How much should I put it?
   [Amount] G 

Van:
   Hmm, there's already
   [Amount] in there.
   It won't fit that much!

Van:
   There isn't even 1G
   inside right now...

Van:
   There's [Amount] inside...
   ~~~Deposit more
   ~~~That's enough
   
Van:
   Alright!
   It's full!!!

   Take good care,

 [Viper Manor (Home)]
 
Radius:
   I believe it has been
   4 years since I retired
   from the Dragoons...
   Sigh...
   Time sure does fly...
   I was shocked to hear of
   Dario's death 3 years ago...
   And now, the general
   and the others are
   missing...
   The manor is in
   shambles...
   I took the liberty
   of conducting my own
   investigation, but
   I have discovered
   nothing...
   All I know is that
   a man named Lynx
   approached the general
   and has involved him
   in some kind of incident.
   The only difference
   with the other world
   you talk about
   is that something has
   happened to the general
   3 years ago...

Radius:
   I just hope that this
   Norris fellow knows
   something...
   
Harle:
   I know not'ing.
   I waz not involved
   wit' ze plan.
   
Harle:

 [Basement, Viper Manor (Home)]
 
Norris:
   Sir Lynx!
   It has been a while, sir.

Norris:
   As you can see, the
   manor is in shambles.
   There is still no sign of
   the general or the others.

Norris:
   We are still investigating
   the area, but it appears that
   the Frozen Flame is not here.
   
Norris:
   Sir... Are you really
   Sir Lynx?
   You seem different
   than I last remember...

Radius:
   You are correct.
   This man is not Lynx.

Norris:
   Excuse me, sir, but
   who might you be?

Radius:
   I am Radius,
   a dragoon.
   Although I have been
   retired for 4 years.

Norris:
   So you are Radius, one
   of the former 4 Devas!?
   It is an honor to
   meet you, sir!

Norris:
   I believe you, sir, but...
   It is still hard to accept
   that this man is not Sir Lynx.

Radius:
   He may look like Lynx, but
   his spirit is of another.

Norris:
   That is...
   quite strange
   if I may say so.

Radius:
   It is up to you what
   you want to believe.

Radius:
   So, what business did
   you have with Lynx?
   Have you uncovered anything
   about the disappearance of
   the general?
   You will be doing us
   a great favor by telling
   us what you know.
   
Norris:
   Very well...
   I will tell you what I know.
   
 [Norris]
   It was actually Sir Lynx
   who approached us about
   the existence of the
   Frozen Flame in El Nido.

   Being from the main continent,
   we had doubted its very existence,
   so I was sent to El Nido
   Archipelago as a spy.

   I had narrowed down the
   location to Viper Manor,
   but it appeared as though
   General Viper and his men
   were in search of it as well.

   Eventually, I was called back to
   Porre, but it was then that
   I heard General Viper and his
   men had disappeared and that the
   manor had been destroyed as such.

   I heard only recently that there
   is good evidence the general and
   his men headed to the Dead Sea.

   The Dead Sea is an ocean
   located to the east,
   surrounded by coral.
   It used to be called the
   Sea of Eden, but even then,
   not many dared enter.
   We investigated the area,
   but to no avail.
   We could find no entrance.
   
Norris:
   It is you, Sir Lynx,
   who wished to change
   this distorted world
   using the Frozen Flame.
   
Harle:
   Ooh la lah!
   Such grand dreamz,
   Monsieur Lynx!

Radius:
   Hold your tongue.

Harle:
   Zut!

Radius:
   So...
   The Dead Sea...

Radius:
   That ocean was called
   the Sea of Eden until
   3 years ago...
   This may just be the
   clue we were looking for.
   Once we uncover Lynx's plans,
   it should be easy enough to
   counter them.

Norris:
   Are you planning to
   go to the Dead Sea?

Norris:
   There is no way to
   get in there.
   We searched all over
   for an entrance, but
   to no avail.
   No one knows anything
   about it, either...
   
Radius:
   Yes, I doubt you will
   be able to get in.
   I'm sure the demi-humans of
   Marbule know something about
   this, but they detest humans.
   Especially those from the
   main continent.
   Perhaps they would give us
   a hint if we were to go.

Norris:
   Then...
   May I join you, sir?

Norris:
   I want to know.
   I want to know if the
   Frozen Flame really exists,
   and about everything that
   has happened here.

Radius:
   What about you?

Harle:
   Hm? Moi?

Harle:
   But of course!
   I will follow zis
   Monsieur Lynx!!!

Marbule -
The village of the demi-humans...

 [Marbule (Home)]
 
Ash:
   Hey?
   I didn't expect any visitors
   in this deserted village.

Ash:
   Hello, my name is Ash.
   I'm an assistant to Sir Toma.
   We're here to investigate
   Marbule. If there's anything
   you'd like to know, feel
   free to ask Sir Toma.
   
Ash:
   Sir Toma should be around
   here, somewhere.
   Oh, and don't pay attention
   to those nasty looking
   monsters walking around.
   There's nothing we
   can do about them.
   
The Great Explorer Toma:
   Hm? Hey, what's up, kid!?
   Did you come here just
   to see the great explorer?
   Just kidding! Hah-hah!
   Hah haha ha ha...!

The Great Explorer Toma:
   Hmm? Hey, what's up, guys!?
   Did you come here just
   to see the great explorer?
   Just kidding! Hah-hah!
   Hah haha ha ha...!
   
The Great Explorer Toma:
   Yeah? What's up?
   ~~~Ask about this village
   ~~~Ask about the Dead Sea
   ~~~Ask about these monsters
   ~~~What's new?

The Great Explorer Toma:
   Marbule used to belong to the
   demi-humans at one point.
   Demi-humans were originally
   located up in the northern
   region, but after Porre's
   colonization,
   they were forced out of the
   mainland and ended up here.
   But their bad luck continued.
   Marbule, with its rich Element
   resources, became the target
   of Element hunters.
   With nowhere else to go, most
   of the demi-humans left the
   village to work on the
   Cruise Ship - S.S. Zelbess -.
   They work as laborers and
   are treated like dirt.
   I feel really bad for them.
   Anyway, that's why you have
   this ghost town here.
   The rooms are still furnished,
   so feel free to spend the
   night if you're tired. Use
   the hut right by the entrance.

The Great Explorer Toma:
   This place has become
   quite the ghost town.
   The rooms are still furnished,
   so feel free to spend the
   night if you're tired. Use
   the hut right by the entrance.

The Great Explorer Toma:
   That's about all I know.
   If you have any other questions,
   ask the sage aboard the Zelbess.

The Great Explorer Toma:
   The Dead Sea!?
   Nobody would dare
   approach that place!
   I don't know the details,
   but I've heard that the
   place is cursed by the most
   hideous dragon!
   Everyone's afraid of defying this
   Dragon God, but being the great
   explorer that I am, I plan to make
   an expedition there someday.
   Oh? So you wanna know how
   to get inside the Dead Sea?
   Rumor has it, there's only
   one way...
   '"Death's Door"'...
   The entrance is out there,
   somewhere...
   Unfortunately, even I don't
   know where this door is.
   Hmmm... Let's see...
   Who might know...?
   Oh yeah!
   Why not ask the sage aboard
   the Cruise Ship - S.S. Zelbess -?

The Great Explorer Toma:
   Hmmm... What's new...
   Oh yeah, I heard a rumor that
   you can hear a woman crying at
   night. People think it's a ghost.
   I've been here several days now,
   but I've yet to encounter
   this ghost.

The Great Explorer Toma:
   Oh, these creepy monsters?
   I'm not too sure, but I believe
   they've been here a long time.
   You can see them, but they
   have no substance.
   You can't touch them, nor can
   they touch you. So there's no
   way to communicate.
   I think people call them
   '"The Black Nightmare."'
   I guess they're like a
   bad dream. Maybe a song
   would wake them up?
   Hah-ha... Just kidding...
   Anyway, there's nothing
   we can do about 'em.
   Don't worry about it.

The Great Explorer Toma:
   If they're a bad dream, maybe
   a song would wake them up?
   Hah-ha... Just kidding...
   Anyway, there's nothing
   we can do about 'em.
   Don't worry about it.
   
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No
   
   You hear voices outside...
   ~~~Check it out
   ~~~Go back to sleep
   
The Great Explorer Toma:
   What are you doing
   up at this hour?
   
The Great Explorer Toma:
   A mermaid?
   A homecoming, maybe?
   Oh...
   You say she was crying?
   Hmmm... A mermaid returns
   in the middle of the
   night, crying...
   Actually, it could possibly
   be that mermaid who lost her
   singing voice...
   Mermaids are known to have
   a beautiful voice and sing
   about love and happiness.
   But mermaids are forbidden
   to sing songs about holding
   grudges against humans.
   If a mermaid breaks the
   taboo, she will lose her
   singing voice.
   I don't blame her though,
   for all that's been happening
   in this day and age...

The Great Explorer Toma:
   You're heading to the
   Zelbess tomorrow, right?
   You should get some sleep.
   Oh, and don't forget to
   give your regards to Captain
   Fargo when you get there.
   He can be devious, so
   keep an eye on him.
   
The Great Explorer Toma:
   So, did you see Captain
   Fargo on the Zelbess?
   Was he up to his old tricks
   again? He never quits.
   Well, it's gettin' late and
   I don't want to keep you.

   And his sister...
   Marcy.

Fargo:
   ......!?
   That child died
   with Zelbess when
   Luccia...

Irenes:
   Yoü do not knöw
   anyt'ing, do yoü...?
   Ör yoü refüse to knöw.
   Yoü önly remember the päst
   which ist fävorable för yoü.
   Luccia tried to säve my
   sister Zelbess...
   But she was önly äble to
   säve the bäby... Marcy...
   Luccia felt respönsible and
   has suppörted Marcy from a
   distänce throughöut her life.
   Look at yoü now...
   Where ist the öld yoü, who had
   the pässion and desire to büild
   a new wörld with my sister?

Fargo:
   I told you...
   The old me is dead...!
   Now what do you want!?
   I don't need to be
   lectured by you!

Irenes:
   ......
   Ünderstood.
   Let me get to the pöint.
   Yoü have täken awäy the
   '"söng"' of the demi-hümans.
   In ötter words, we would like
   yoü to free the säge...

Fargo:
   I see...
   But why?
   You know that song, too,
   don't you?

Irenes:
   Dö not feign ignörance,
   Fargo.
   Yoü should knöw better...
   Only when the söng is süng
   by one with speciäl pöwer
   can the effects be bröught
   into full pläy.
   My sister, Zelbess, ist deäd, and
   yoü have täken awäy the säge.
   Marbule nö lönger hast its true
   pöwer without dat söng...
   Marbule is now a nesting gröund
   för evil dreäm spirits...

Fargo:
   Interesting...
   But so what?
   I don't want outsiders
   in Marbule...
   That suits me just fine.
   
Irenes:
   How much lönger are yoü
   göing to be stübborn?
   The Marbule yoü once knew
   ist nö longer there...!
   Yoü will önly find a
   nightmäre.
   Öpen yöur eyes to reälity...

Fargo:
   I'm not releasing the sage,
   no matter what you say.

Irenes:
   ......
   Fine...
   I will not beseech yoü.
   I will not give up on the
   restörätion of Marbule.
   I will continüe to strive
   to mäke my sister's dreäm
   come trüe...

Fargo:
   ......
   
Fargo:
   Hey, you're a new face!
   Relax and stay awhile.
   This ship belongs to
   me,
   myself,
   and I.
   I want everyone to
   enjoy themselves,

   you like.

Miki:
   Nikki...!!!
   I wanna be alone
   right now...
   I'm not in the mood
   to talk...

Young Woman:
   Hah!
   You're a strange threesome...
   And I thought everyone
   was here to see Nikki!
   You don't look like
   typical Nikki fans...
   Are you fans?
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No, we're not

Young Woman:
   I figured you were...

Young Woman:
   You don't have to say
   that just to please me.
 
Young Woman:
   I'm Miki.
   The lead dancer for
   the Magical Dreamers.

Miki:
   Nobody seems to understand
   the heart and soul of our

   I want everyone to get

   Alright, go.
   Don't slack off!

   That old man used to be

   But now he's down in the dumps,
   moppin' the floors of the Zelbess.
   Through this door is the

   We'd like to
   get through to
   the Grand Slam...
   
Fargo:
   Oh?
   The Grand Slam, eh...?
   So you're out for blood...
   Tell me, where did you
   folks come from?
   
Member:
   Marbule.
   
Fargo:
   What...? Marbule...?
   What are you doing here,
   anyway?
   
Member:
   We're looking
   for the sage
   of Marbule.
   
Fargo:
   Well, well, well...
   I'm sorry, but there's no one of
   that sort aboard the Zelbess.
   Plus, I don't want strangers
   ruining my fun on my ship.
   Sorry... I can't grant
   you access.

Fargo:
   But that wouldn't be
   fun now, would it?
   The foundation of the
   Zelbess is entertainment.
   What do you say you
   try your luck?
   
Member:
   Try out luck...?
   
Fargo:
   That's right.
   There's a casino
   down below.
   If you win, I'll give
   you access to the Grand Slam.
   But if you lose, how about you
   give me your boat docked by
   the entrance?
   Well, what do you say?
   ~~~Let's do it!
   ~~~No, thanks

Fargo:
   Good.
   That's the spirit!
   I'll meet you down
   at the casino!
   Don't chicken out now...
   Hah hahahaha!

Fargo:
   Had enough?
   I'll take you on anytime!
   
Fargo:
   If you win, I'll give you
   access to the Grand Slam.
   If I win, I get your boat.
   Well...?
   ~~~Let's do it!
   ~~~No, thanks
   
 [Casino, SS Zelbess (Home)]
 
Sneff:
   Noooooo...!
   Not again...!!!

Fargo:
   Give it up, old man Sneff.
   You don't have what it takes.
   Just keep doing your shows,
   that's all.

Sneff:
   Nuff...!!!
   One of these days, I'm gonna
   slap your dirty fface wiff
   a wad of cash and get the
   hell offa this ship!

Fargo:
   Well, well, well...
   Look who's here.
   That old man has built up
   quite a debt from this casino.
   So now, I own him.
   I suggest you don't let
   the same happen to you!

Fargo:
   Excuse me, everyone... May I
   have your attention please...
   I need to have a private
   game with these folks.
   Would you mind leaving
   us alone for a while?
   I'll clear any debts
   you may have.

 [Man]
   Are you serious, Captain?

Fargo:
   Did I stutter?

 [Man]
   Alright!
   
 [Man]
   The captain is G-O-O-D!
   Better watch it!
 
 [Man]
   Take it easy on 'em,
   Captain.

Fargo:
   Hah hahahahah!

Fargo:
   Thanks everyone.
   I'll be done soon.

Fargo:
   OK then, let's begin.
   
 [Operator]
   The usual, Captain?

   Fargo:
   Yes, '"Sudden Death."'
   The rules are simple.
   Press the x Button after
   the dealer spins the compass.
   We'll alternate turns.
   The pointer will stop on
   north, east, south or west.
   Should the pointer stop on
   south, where it stands now,
   you lose.
   Simple game, isn't it?
   Just don't make the pointer
   stop on south. It's a game of
   luck rather than skill.
   
Fargo:
   Heh heh...
   You're up.
   
Fargo:
   ...Luck of the devil...
   Here we go.
   
Fargo:
   Hah hahahah!
   You've got a ways to go
   before you can beat me!!!
   
Fargo:
   Well then, it looks like
   you owe me your boat.
   Don't hold a grudge.
   I won that game fair
   and square.
   I guess that means you'll
   have to swim back!
   Hah hahahaha!

   ~~~Sure
   ~~~No, thanks

Sneff:
   Excellent!
   Please step up
   to the stage.

Sneff:
   Are you ready!?

Sneff:
   That's too bad.
   Then, ffor my card trick...
 
Sneff:
   Nuff!
   Where do you think
   you're going!?
   
Sneff:
   Gotcha!!!

Sneff:
   Ooooh nooooo!!!
   I strained my back!!!

 [Crewman]
   Hey, Sneff,
   you alright?

 [Crewman]
   Maybe you should take
   it easy, Pops?
   You're not getting
   any younger!

Sneff:
   SHUT UP!!!
   I still got it!!!
   
 [Crewman]
   Yeah, yeah...
   But, Pops, you can't
   perform your magic now
   that your back's out!
   Plus, what are you going
   to do about those people
   you transformed into cats!?

Sneff:
   I'm sorry, ffolks.
   Actually, there's absolutely
   no trick behind that magic.
   An old troll gave me a
   mysterious berry during
   my travels, long ago.
   She was saying someffing
   about the Bend of Time...
   Anyway, affter I ate the berry,
   I was able to transfform people
   into cats.
   I wish I could change you
   back to your human fform,
   but my achin' back...
   I'll need to lie down a bit,
   so you'll have to stay that
   way ffor a while.
   I hope you understand...

   looking for the sage...?
   I don't like the fact that
   they arrived here on a
   Porre boat, either...
   Who are they...?
   
Fargo:
   Hello there, kitty...

Fargo:
   She sure loved cats...

Fargo:
   Zelbess...

Fargo:
   You would look into
   the mirror and say...
   '"How I pity you, mirror,
    for man does not see you
    as the mirror that you are."'
   Did I see you as who you
   were back then?
   And is that my true
   self I see now?
   What would you think of
   me if you saw me today...?
   ...Aboard this ship,
   cheating people out
   of money...

   The song of the demi-humans...?

   That song can save
   Marbule, right?

Irenes:
   Jä...
   The önly öne who mäy knöw
   about the true pöwers of
   dis song mäy be the säge.
   However, Fargo...
   knöwing sö, will not return

   Wouldn't it make sense if
   the sage just sang the song?

   He ist much too öld för dis, and
   all the läbor he hast endured...

   strongly about this.
   Plus, I want to know
   more about the song...

Irenes:
   T'ank yoü...
   I am gläd yoü accept.
   I believe the säge can
   be. found outside a pläce
   called the '"Grand Slam."'

Nikki:
   You know...
   For some reason, the more
   I look at you, the more
   nostalgic I feel...
   Have we met somewhere before?

   Hah hahaha!!!
   Too bad, old man!
   You have to learn
   when to quit!

Sneff:
   Nuff...!
   I wanted to buy some
   cat ffood ffor those ffolks...

Fargo:

   For whom?

   None of your beeswax!

   yet, but...
   I fink I can
   change you back...

Sneff:
   Uhhh...
   I have to start offf like
   that to concentrate.
   Anyway, here we go...

Sneff:

   That's a load offf

   I better stop using
   that magic.
   Listen, I'm very sorry
   you had to put up
   wiff being a cat.

Fargo:
   I can't allow you to
   go to the Grand Slam.

Nikki:
   But why?
   I really need to talk to
   the sage about teaching
   me the song...!
   Or else...that
   beautiful island, Marbule,
   will be gone forever!
   I can't just stand here
   and do nothing...!

Fargo:
   You don't understand...
   True beauty is found
   within a dying entity.
   Therefore, I will watch over
   Marbule when its time comes...
   Furthermore, you and I
   have a contract.
   For the time being, you
   are in my possession.
   What am I supposed to do
   should anything happen to you?
   That would be a great
   financial loss for me...

Nikki:
   So you're saying
   I'm nothing but a
   mere object...

Fargo:
   ......
   If that is what you
   think, so be it.

   father I used to know!?
   You're my father,
   aren't you!?

   in such dubious acts!?

   I am no longer the
   father you once knew...
   I lost everything when your
   mother, Zelbess passed away...
   Including myself...
   Laugh at me all you want.
   Pity me if you wish...
   But remember this,
   Nikki, man is not as
   strong as you think.

   ...I......

   challenge me again?

   You should quit while

   Come challenge me again later.

   Why do you wish to
   enter the Dead Sea?
   Do you realize humans
   have stolen our land
   along with our legendary
   treasure?
   Humans will do anything
   for profit, no matter
   what the cost.
   The demi-humans aboard
   this ship are living
   proof.
   We have lost all sense
   of pride, with no dreams
   for tomorrow.
   We just cling to the
   mercy of humans every
   day.

Sage:
   Why must we demi-humans
   lend a hand to humans?
   What will you do if
   I refuse...?
   Will you go as far as
   using brute force?
   ~~~Of course!
   ~~~Let's talk it over...

Sage:
   I see...
   Then prepare yourselves...
   
Sage:
   Heh heh heh...
   So you wish to
   avoid conflict?
   You also need the
   courage to defeat others
   to get through life.
   Do not forget.

Sage:
   If there is nothing in
   particular, please leave.
   There is no point in you
   hanging around here.
   
Sage:
   I thought you were leaving?
   ~~~Where's the Dead Sea?
   ~~~It's nothing

Sage:
   Why must we demi-humans
   lend a hand to humans?
   What will you do if
   I refuse...?
   Will you go as far as
   using brute force?
   ~~~Of course!
   ~~~Let's talk it over...

Sage:
   I see...
   Then prepare yourselves...

Sage:
   Heh heh heh...
   So you wish to
   avoid conflict?
   You also need the
   courage to defeat others
   to get through life.
   Do not forget.

Sage:
   If there is nothing in
   particular, please leave.
   There is no point in you
   hanging around here.

Sage:
   Hmmm...
   I sense that you are quite
   serious about entering the
   Dead Sea...
   Could it be that you are
   carrying the burden of fate
   for the human race, no,
   for all life-forms...?
   Then let me give you this...
   I am sure you will be able
   to put it to good use.
   But just remember...opening
   a new gate also brings
   forth a new misfortune.
   Do not forget.

   Fiddler Crab!

Sage:
   There is an area near
   the Dead Sea where the
   tides are different.
   Use that item there.
   Nature will take
   over from there.

Sage:
   Heh heh heh...
   How do you expect to
   help others when you
   can't even finish the
   fights you start?
   
Nikki:
   Finally...

Nikki:
   I knew I'd find you here...
   You know the legendary
   song of Marbule, right?
   I want you to teach me
   the song...
   Please...!

Sage:
   Why do humans have
   to be so selfish?
   That song only has a place
   in the hearts of demi-humans.
   Why should I teach you the song?

Nikki:
   Irenes asked me...

Sage:
   Heh... I see that
   she has not given up.

Nikki:
   But it's not only
   because she asked me to.
   I personally have a great
   interest in that song.
   A beautiful song, originating
   from a beautiful island...
   I'm not 100% sure I'll be
   able to pull it off...
   But if it means I can save
   someone through my song...

Sage:
   There was once a man
   just like you...

Nikki:
   ......!
   Who?

Sage:
   Fargo...

Nikki:
   ...My father!?

Sage:
   Ahhh, so you are his son...
   I guess history does
   repeat itself.
   I had high hopes
   for that man.
   High hopes that he would one
   day tear down the wall between
   demi-humans and humans.
   But look at us now.
   The walls seem even higher.

Nikki:
   Please...
   Don't speak badly
   of my father...
   No one understands
   the pain and suffering
   he's going through!
   Even though he has built up
   this lively place, he screams
   in sorrow alone, within his
   dark, deep self...
   But I can hear him!
   His screams of despair,
   which no one else can hear...
   or wants to hear...

Sage:
   ......
   So you can
   hear him, too...

Nikki:
   I beg of you, please...
   I bet if my father
   hears that song...

Sage:
   I am sorry, but I have
   other areas of the ship
   I must mop...

Nikki:
   But...!

Sage:
   ...While I hum
   myself a song...

Nikki:
   Then you'll...!?

Nikki:
   I saw the way you
   fought back there.
   I've been looking for
   tough guys like you.
   It would be an honor
   if we could talk inside
   my ship.

   Hey, Pops, I heard
   you paid off your

   You're not pullin'

Sneff:
   Why would I lie about
   someffing like that!?
   There's no reason ffor
   me to stay here now.
   I'm gettin' offa here.

 [Peppor]
   Th-This is kinda sad...
   It was 3 years ago when...
   you shook us in after you
   found us wandering around
   with amnesia...

 [Solt]
   We are greatly grateful
   to you...!!!
   We still have a ways to go
   with our stand up comedy
   act, but one day, we will
   really, truly make you laugh!

Sneff:
   Lank and Stout...
   Iff I run into any
   of your comrades,
   I'll be sure to tell
   them you're doin' well.

Sneff:
   Good luck to you

   And go on that diet, already.

 [Crewman]
   Yeah, I know...

   Sniff...

Sneff:
   Come on, guys,

   This won't be the last

   Take care, everyone.
   
Sneff:

   Nah...

 [Crewman]
   Huh? But why...!?
   You were always talkin'
   about gettin' outta here...
   
Sneff:
   ...Not until you're able
   to handle 4 swords...
   And not until someone
   laughs at Lank and Stout's
   jokes...
   I can't just leave my
   ffamily behind...

 [Crewman]
   P-Pops!!!

Sneff:
   But I just want you to know,
   I may be traveling wiff
   these people whenever
   they call upon me.
   Well then, who's up next?
   
 [Peppor]
   W-We are!

 [Solt]
   Rightly right!!!

Sneff:
   And you two should
   be practicin'
   instead of crying!

 [Crewman]
   Yes, sir!

 [Crewman]
   It feels good
   bein' yelled at
   by Pops again...

Sneff:
   Well...?
   What are you going to do?
   ~~~Have him join your party
   ~~~Refuse him
 

Sneff:
   Call me anytime.
   
Sneff:
   They're still too green,

   I guess they do need me!

 [Magical Dreamers Ship (Home)]
 
Nikki:
   Rockin'!
   I knew you'd come!

Nikki:
   Well, now that we're
   all here, here's my idea.
   How would you all like to
   save an island with a song?

Miki:
   Hah! Think before
   you speak, Nikki!
   You've gotta be
   out of your mind!

Nikki:
   No, I'm serious.
   According to Irenes,
   the island of Marbule is
   infested with monsters.
   Their only weakness is a
   demi-human song that the
   sage knows...
   While we perform our gig
   near the island, these
   people will exterminate
   all the monsters.
   That's the plan.
   Of course you'll help
   out, right?
   ~~~Of course!
   ~~~No, we can't

Nikki:
   Rockin'!
   I knew you'd help.

Nikki:
   ......!?
   But you're my only hope!
   I have no one else to turn to!
   Besides, you owe the sage
   a favor, don't you? Please...!

Irenes:
   I shall gat'er all the
   demi-hümans on dis ship
   to pläy backup instruments.
   It will be difficult för
   hümans to pläy the pröper
   nötes för our song...

Miki:
   But don't we have to
   bring this ship over
   to Marbule?
   Our ship's chained to
   the Zelbess, you know?

   And plus we have a contract
   with that Fargo guy!
   We can't just leave...!

Nikki:
   Yes, I know.
   I don't intend to go
   with our ship alone.
   Wouldn't want to disappoint
   our fans aboard the Zelbess...
   The only hurdle left to clear
   now is how to convince my fath...
   I mean, Fargo.
   Inc17002I'll leave that up
   to you, Irenes.
   We have to concentrate
   on setting up the gig.

Miki:
   Hey, you know... This is
   starting to sound interesting...
   It's almost like a test to see
   how far we can take our show.

Nikki:
   So you're with me on
   this, Miki!?
   Great! Let's get ready
   for rehearsal, everyone!
   
Nikki:
   Thank you for your
   support, Sage.

Sage:
   Heh heh heh...
   I trust you will
   put on a good '"gig!"'

Irenes:
   Excüse me...

Irenes:

   yoü in quite a täsk...

   I see...
   Please cäll on me
   änytime.
   Do let me know if yoü
   encounter someone dat mäy
   be äble to cönvince Fargo...
   
Miki:
   I know he's really into it,
   but Nikki has yet to come
   up with a script...
   When can we expect to
   get some rehearsals done...?

Miki:
   What's Nikki doing with an
   old geezer like that...?
   What is he up to?
 
 [Roadie]
   Nikki, you do realize that
   this concert has a lot more
   riding on it than just
   pleasing the fans...
   Good luck!

   Oh, and I have a message
   from the sage.
   It says...
   '"Use the Fiddler Crab
    where the tide around
    the Dead Sea differs."'
   I have no idea what it means.
   I hope you do!
   
   Good job, everyone!
   
Nikki:
   ......!?
   Another me...?
   I would love to have an
   opportunity to jam with you...!

Nikki:
   Rockin'!

   Hmph...
   I have no interest in

   I seek only enigma

 [Death's Door (Home)]
   
Radius:
   Hmmm...
   I sense a strange
   vibe in the air...
   Stay alert, Serge.
   Let us proceed.
   
Radius:
   W-What is the evil sword,
   Masamune, doing here!?

Radius:
   Ugh... It's no use...
   We will not be able to
   proceed without going mad.

Radius:
   Serge...
   We have no choice but
   to withdraw for now.
   
Radius:
   The path appears to be
   blocked off by that sword.
   He must already be in there...
   The negative sentiment
   associated with that
   sword has intensified.
   It will be impossible to
   proceed without going mad...

Norris:
   Is that the so-called
   evil sword, Masamune?
   Sir Radius, do you know
   anything about this sword?

Radius:
   ......
   
Norris:
   What shall we do?
   We cannot make our way
   into the Dead Sea without
   removing that sword.
 
Member:
   There has to be a way!
   The Dead Sea is right
   under our nose!
   
Radius:
   Only the dragon sword,
   Einlanzer, can break the
   seal of the Masamune.
   
Norris:
   The Einlanzer?
   The sword forged by
   ancient Dragonians?
   
Member:
   The Einlanzer?
   
Radius:
   Yes...
   The legendary holy sword,
   forged by the Dragonites...
   I have placed that sword to rest
   beside its rightful owner, Garai.
   May he rest in peace
   within that cavern...
   Although it pains me
   to disturb his eternal sleep,
   we have no other choice...

Member:
   Where is this cavern...?
   
Radius:
   We know it today as the
   '"Isle of the Damned."'
   It used to be an ordinary cavern
   until it mutated into a nesting
   ground for demons...
   I believe this may be the
   result of Garai's sentiments
   which lingered.
   A negative sentiment, which
   the holy sword could not
   even restrain.
   In order to make our way
   in there, we need a certain
   item that Garai used while
   he was still alive.
   I have stored it away in a hut
   where Garai and I used to train.
   We must go and get this item...
   
Radius:
   We must do something about
   that sword in order to proceed.
   Let us withdraw for now.
   
Radius:
   We need the power of
   the Einlanzer to
   destroy that sword.
   We must withdraw for now.
   Let us stop by my hut.
   There is something I'd like
   to pick up before heading to
   the Isle of the Damned.
   
Radius:
   We need the power of
   the Einlanzer to
   destroy that sword.
   We must withdraw for now.
   
Radius:
   It took you long enough.
   I've been waiting forever.

Radius:
   ......
   Dario's father, Garai,
   and I used to frequent
   this island for our
   training...
   
 [Flashback, Hermit's Hideaway]
   Radius:
   Sigh...
   I lose again...
   
Garai:
   Hmph!
   You're always a
   half-step too slow.
   And you have a habit
   of turning your wrist
   when you swing down.
   I can read your every move.
   
Radius:
   Hah! You're about the only one
   who knows that, since we
   practice together so often.
   
Garai:
   And I thought
   I was a genius.
   
Radius:
   Yeah, right...
   
Radius:
   The Einlanzer is a legendary
   holy sword passed onto
   the most skilled swordsman
   of the Acacia Dragoons.
   It belonged to Garai before
   Dario took over the title.
   He was a magnificent dragoon...
   
 [Flashback, Unknown Area (Divine Dragon Falls?)]

Radius:
   Could this really be it?
   The sword of legend...
   the Masamune!!!

Radius:
   My word...
   
Garai:
   Leave it alone!
   There's something...
   wrong about this.
   
Radius:
   What could be wrong?
   This is a legendary
   sword!!!
   
Garai:
   No!
   Don't touch it!
   
Radius:
   See, Garai...
   
Radius:
   There's nothing
   to fear!
   
Garai:
   ......
   Hmm, perhaps not.
   Let's go, Radius!
   No use hanging round
   this eerie place.
   
Radius:
   Aahhh...
   
Radius:
   The Masamune...
   That sword is cursed
   with hate and sorrow...
   Anyone who lays his hands
   on it will be overcome
   with negative sentiments
   and will be driven mad...
   I......

Radius:
   ......
   Enough talk from
   an old man...
   Just wait here a moment.
   
Radius:
   Sorry to keep you waiting.
   With this mirror, we should be
   able to make it to the inner
   parts of the Isle of the Damned.
 
   Garai's Keepsake.

Radius:
   Let us be off to the
   '"Isle of the Damned."'

   back on that day...

Radius:
   I was overcome by the
   power of that sword!
 
 [Flashback (Unknown Setting)]
 
Garai:
   Who'd have thought we'd
   find the Masamune in a
   place like this...!?
   
Radius:
   I know...
   
Radius:
   Hey, Garai...
   
Garai:
   What?

Garai:
   Aaarrrggghhh...!?
   What the...?
   
Radius:
   HAHAHAHAHAA!
   Now I'm the top
   swordsman of the
   Acacia Dragoons!

Radius:
   Hah, I did it!
   I'm the greatest!
   HAHAHAHAAH...

Radius:
   Huh?
   What happened?

Radius:
   Oh Lord...?
   What have I done?

Radius:
   NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

 [Chapter]
The Masamune -
The blood-stained sword of evil...

 [Isle of the Damned (Home)]
 
Radius:
   I know I lost my sanity
   because of that sword...
   But I must admit, the sword
   is not entirely to blame.
   I was jealous of Garai...
   I wanted to be the better
   swordsman.
   The once renowned Masamune...
   '"The Holy Sword That
   Conquered Darkness."'
   Could it be merely a
   tool for murder...?
 
 [Garai]
   Should you feel remorse
   for what you have done,
   then may you fall by my
   sword, you traitor!
   
Radius:
   Garai!?
   No...!
   
Radius:
   Listen to me, Garai!
   We need the Einlanzer to
   seal the cursed evil sword!

Garai:
   Then express your
   intent to the Einlanzer...
   ...As a true swordsman would do.
   You must defeat me to proceed!
   
Radius:
   In order to  believe
   in what is right...
   must one suffer
   pain and sorrow?

Garai:
   Do not hesitate.
   Show me the pride and honor
   of the Acacia Dragoons.
   Come, Radius!

Garai:
   Cowards...
 
   [Einlanzer]!
   
Radius:
   I have always been prepared
   to fall to a sword held by
   one of your sons...
   Perhaps Glenn will take
   on that role, now that
   Dario is gone.

Radius:
   However, I must attend to
   some unfinished business.
   Please wait a little longer.
   Garai... Forgive me, my friend...
   
 [Death's Door (Home)]
 
Radius:
   Come, Serge.
   The Einlanzer shall
   lead the way!
   
Radius:
   Oh, Garai...
   We shall use the holy
   powers of the Einlanzer...

Radius:
   The sword is a reflection of
   one's soul. How I pity you...
   You've done no wrong, either.

Radius:
   I just hope that, one day,
   that sword will be
   freed of enmity...
   
Radius:
   The Dead Sea...
   I cannot imagine what kind
   of spectacle lies ahead...
   
Radius:
   Where do you think you're
   going, Serge? The Dead Sea
   is right before our eyes!

   That wounded child...

   Where are you going!?

Wazuki:
   There's no way we can set

   We don't have a second to

   Or else...Serge will...

Miguel:
   BUT...!!!

   I don't care what lies

   I'm going.
   There's no way I'll allow

 [Nadia's Bell, Ruined Future (Home)]
 
Miguel:
   Yes... I've been here
   in this very place...
   For 14 years...
   It wasn't like this
   when I got here, though...
   An incident that occurred
   10 years ago, transformed
   it into the Dead Sea.
   
Miguel:
   Don't you know...?
   There's nothing in the world as
   ruthless or impartial as death.
   All living matter ages over time
   and eventually dies...
   No matter how mighty or tiny
   its life force...
   So being alive means
   you're creeping closer to
   death with every second...

Miguel:
   But there's none
   of that here.
   No one and nothing ages.
   Nothing wastes away.

Miguel:
   This quiet, boundless, and
   beautiful world...
   An ideal world, straight
   out of a fairy tale, isn't it?
   048A place and time
   that belongs to no one...
   Res nullius...
   It's because this is a future
   that was eliminated!!!

Miguel:
   History is composed of
   choices and divergences.
   Each choice you make
   creates a new world and
   brings forth a new future.
   But at the same time, 
   you're eliminating a
   different future with the
   choices you didn't make.

Miguel:
   A future denied of all
   existence because of a
   change in the past...
   A future that was destroyed
   even before it was born
   rests here...condensed
   into the Dead Sea.
 
Member:
   How is that possible...!?

Member:
   How can this be!?

Harle:

Miguel:
   '"Fate."'
   Our lives are governed
   by fate.
   Fate knows all
   and controls all.
   No one can run
   from fate...

Miguel:
   Even your presence here
   was predestined...
   long, long ago.

Miguel:
   Wouldn't you all like to
   become one with this world?

Miguel:
   To be a part of eternity?
   How about it, Serge?
   You need no longer
   struggle alone, nor fear
   an uncertain tomorrow.
   
Miguel:
   Well? What do you say?
   ~~~Refuse!!!
   ~~~Accept...

Member:
   Serge!?
   You can't be
   serious!?

Member:
   We can't just let
   ourselves die here!

Miguel:
   I see...
   I guess there's only
   one thing left to do then...
   I take it you're trying to
   restore the dimensional
   distortion?
   If you defeat me and liberate
   this place, the distortion
   will return to the way it was.

Miguel:
   I guess this is it...
   Just as there are times of
   peace, there are times of war...
   You don't have to hold back.
   Attack me with all your
   soul if you wish to live.
   Let fate take
   its course...!!!

Miguel:
   There's no use running.
   I'm sorry, but I can't
   let you leave here alive.
   
Miguel:
   You can't leave.
   Not until we settle this.
   
Miguel:
   Are you ready?
   ~~~Anytime!
   ~~~No, not yet

Miguel:
   Then let's begin.
   No one can escape death.

Miguel:
   No worries.
   Take your time.
   We have all the time
   in the world...
   
Miguel:
   Well done!
   That's the way, Serge!
   My, you have grown strong.
   Maybe...just maybe...you and
   your friends have the power
   to defeat FATE and build a
   new future for humanity.

Miguel:
   The Dead Sea is the true
   form of this planet's future.
   That's right...
   At one stage our world was on
   the verge of such inevitable
   destruction...
   That was in 1999, when the
   parasitical alien life-form known
   as Lavos awoke after centuries
   of feeding off this planet.
   Lavos fell from the heavens a
   countless number of years ago
   and burrowed deep beneath the
   surface to eat and sleep.
   Slowly but deliberately, Lavos
   devoured our planet from the
   inside out...waiting for the time
   to ripen for its true awakening.
   Finally Lavos did awake and
   manifested its true form on
   the surface of the planet.
   That's when our world faced a
   death from which there seemed
   no possibility of escape...
   
Miguel:
   Were it not for a teenage boy
   and his group of adventurer
   friends, that is...
   These young heroes caught a
   glimpse of this planet's future
   destruction as it appeared in
   the year 2300.
   They realized they could not
   turn their backs on our planet,
   even if its death would not be
   anywhere near their lifetime.
   Time traveling from epoch to
   epoch, they battled Lavos for
   the future of our planet, and
   eventually won.
   But in saving our planet from
   the death Lavos was going to
   bring about, they also changed
   the course of history...
 
 [Lucca]
   At that very moment,
   this whole future time
   axis ceased to exist.
   Call it cause and effect...
   It is just a problem of
   possibilities, after all...
   In this world, there are
   no such things as
   absolutes or certainties.
 
 [Marle]
   But the future that
   was supposed to have
   disappeared is about
   to be restored here...
   The future destruction
   of our planet is going
   to become a reality in
   this world once again...
 
 [Crono]
   The vengeance of the
   future we killed is
   about to begin...
   With Serge serving
   as the trigger...
   
Miguel:
   Perhaps, or perhaps not...
   Either way, it is all part of
   the grand game of the gods...
   and '"goddesses!"'
   People are dragged into playing
   this game...forced to put their
   own lives on the line...without
   even knowing the rules.
   Without even being allowed to
   complain, they try to do their
   best under the conditions
   placed upon them...
   The only alternative is to give
   up and leave the playing field
   in a forfeit...

Miguel:
   Three years ago, members
   of the Acacia Dragoons
   from Termina visited here...
   Those knights were after
   the Frozen Flame, of course.
   But instead they became
   salt for the Dead Sea...
   You see, only the chosen
   one can approach the
   Flame...

Miguel:
   It looks like Fate has made
   its decision and has started
   to carry it out now...
   FATE doesn't want the Frozen
   Flame to awaken in this place
   at this time...
   It would choose to destroy the
   Flame along with the whole Dead
   Sea, than to allow its enemies
   to take hold of the Flame...

Miguel:
   This lost future is about to
   disappear into the darkness
   beyond the dimensions again...
   You have no time to spare.
   You must leave here
   immediately!
   Quick...go!
 
 [FATE]
   I love you so much...

   That is why I
   sometimes desire to
   smash you to bits!!!

Miguel:
   Don't worry about me!
   You must go now!

Miguel:
   Farewell, Serge!
   The future is yours
   for the taking...
   You...the one that the
   Frozen Flame has chosen!

Miguel:
   My dear Leena...
   May you live in a
   happier tomorrow!

Member:
   We're not
   going to
   make it!

   down the fire of that forge.
   
   Hey!
   Did you understand that!?
   
   Ahh, stop it!
   That's dangerous!!!

Zappa:
   A craftsman's workshop
   is a dangerous place for
   a layman.
   It's yir own damn fault
   for coming near it.
   Besides, by what need do ah
   have to listen yir order?
   Ah'll take no orders from ye.
   Begone with ye, for ah've work
   to finish.

 [Porre Soldier]
   So you are not going to
   stop work no matter what?

Zappa:
   Don't make me tell ye
   the same thing twice.
   Ah've got a short temper.
   If ye ken what ah said,
   then get yirself out.

 [Porre Officer]
   ......
   Very well.
   If that is your answer,
   I take it.
   I will let you go this time,

Zappa:
   Whoa, is no that the
   Rainbow!?
   When ah was a lad, ah traveled
   with me wife searchin' for it
   but...
   So, it really exists. Ah would
   love to get mah hands on it...
   but from what ah can tell, this
   thing can't be forged by meself.
   Now, if we had another skilled
   blacksmith like yours truly,
   that would be a different story.
   Rather unlikely story, though.
   Hahaha!!!

   Ye be me...!?

   Ah need yir help.
   Ah want to hammer this thing

   hammerin'?
   It be a wee bit hard
   by meself, but two of
   us working together
   should be a breeze.

Zappa:
   Hmm...
   Ah would love to help ye...
   But this here hammer's
   too weak for the job.
   If ah had a sturdier hammer...
   Looks like ah'm no use
   to ye for the time being.
   My apologies.
   
Zappa:
   Ay...
   Ye might be right.
   
Pierre:
   That Serge, who had the
   privilege of meeting moi,
   was a villain after all...
   It is just as moi thought...
   you can never trust those
   silent types...!

Skelly:
   Nyak-nyak-nyak!
   As I always said,
   grandma makes the best
   spearhead shark soup in
   the world!
 
 [The Dragon's Tail, Termina (Another)]
    
 [Barkeep]
   W-Who is it?

   Y-You?
   A Porre soldier is with
   you, too...!?
   W-Well, in th-that case
   it can't be helped.
   Just wait right there!
   I'll unlock it for you.

   Y-You are...
   J-Just wait right there!
   I'll unlock it for you.
   
   Here, go in from
   the left side!
   
 [Hideout, Termina (Another)]
 
Zoah:
   WE MEET AGAIN...
   
Karsh:
   It's been a while, Lynx...
   Or is it Serge?

Karsh:
   ...?
   That Porre scumbag's with you!?
   Humph, well as long as you're
   here, you're one of us.
   You! Stay put and listen to
   what we gotta say!

Karsh:
   After we fought you guys,
   we also entered Fort Dragonia
   too...
   
 [Flashback]

Karsh:
   General!!!

Karsh:
   !!!
   You're...!?

Karsh:
   He disappeared!?
   ......!
   Damn!

Karsh:
   This is bad...
   General!
   Are you alright!?

Viper:
   U-Ughhh...
   Riddel...

Karsh:
   ......

Karsh:
   Don't just stand around!
   Help the general!!!

Zoah:
   I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS
   WOULD HAPPEN TO THE GENERAL...

Marcy:
   Like...I can't believe it...

Zoah:
   WHAT IN DRAGOON'S NAME
   HAPPENED HERE...?

Marcy:
   So, like, what are all
   these shiny shards...?

Karsh:
   Not now!
   We have to stop
   the bleeding!
   Marcy, you pick up
   those broken pieces!
 
 [Hideout, Termina (Another)]
 
Karsh:
   We brought the general to
   Hermit's Hideaway and prayed
   for his recovery.
   He was able to escape death,
   but he still needs rest.
   However, we can't leave the
   manor for too long...
   So we came back here, leaving
   Marcy behind to take care
   of him, only to find...

Zoah:
   THE PORRE MILITARY HAD TAKEN
   CONTROL OF TERMINA...
   
Karsh:
   DAMMIT!
   What a shame!!!
   
Karsh:
   Because of them Porres!!!
   Whaddaya got to say to that!?
   
Norris:
   ......
   I, too, question the methods
   the military has taken.
   That is why I am acting in
   line with Sir Lynx...

Karsh:
   Hmph!!!
   Then don't ya dare
   get in my way!
   
Zoah:
   WE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON:
   THE GENERAL TALKS IN HIS
   SLEEP.
   LYNX IS BEHIND THIS,
   CORRECT?

Karsh:
   That bastard.
   He's not gonna get away
   with this!
   We've got some fault in all
   of this, so we gotta do
   something about it.

Karsh:
   But first, we've gotta rescue
   Lady Riddel.
   She's being held captive at the
   manor, which the Porre military
   has converted into their
   headquarters...
   Hey, with your uniform, you can
   enter undetected, right?
   Let's join forces for the time
   being!
   It's not too late to go after him!

Zoah:
   ONE OF US WILL REMAIN
   HERE TO COLLECT INFO.
   THE OTHER WILL ENTER
   THE MANOR.
   LET US MEET AFTERWARDS.

Karsh:
   Oh yeah. The shards on
   the ground must've been
   the Dragon Tear...
   We've gathered as many as
   possible, but we don't
   have any use for it.
   You can have them.

   Tear of Hate!

   Whom do you want to join?
   ~~~Karsh
   ~~~Zoah

   Karsh joined your party!

   ZOAH JOINED YOUR PARTY!
   
Zoah:
   WE HAVE GOT TO HURRY.
   NOT MUCH TIME.

Zoah:
   WATCH OUT.
   WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
   THE PORRE MILITARY WILL
   PULL OFF.
   
Karsh:
   We don't have much time.
   Let's get a move on it!

Karsh:
   We're counting on ya!
   
Zappa:
   Karsh...!?
   Ye be alive, lad!
   Thank the heavens...
   Go show yer face to
   mother as well. She's been
   awaiting yir return.

Karsh:
   I don't know what's going on,
   but once this is settled,
   I'll do that.

Zappa:
   Aye, dinnae forget!
   
 [Barkeep]
   Be careful!
 
 [Zappa's Smithy, Termina (Another)}
 
Zippa:
   Karsh, come back to yir home
   a little more often!
   Oh, and before ah forget,
   we've rented yir room
   to Mr. Pierre for a while.

Karsh:
   Whaaat?
   Why the hell didja
   do that for!

Zippa:
   Don't worry.
   Yir '"illustration books"'
   are safely stored away.

Karsh:
   Ugh!!!
   
Zippa:
   Oh dear, where are ye goin'?
   Ah thought ye still had work
   to do?
   
Karsh:
   Holy smokes, a fruitcake
   like you in MY room!?
   Arrgh, this makes me sick!

Pierre:
   This man is rather vulgaire...
   As a Deva, you must show
   more grace and refinement!

Karsh:
   Arrgh, this guy's useless!
 
 [Termina (Another)]
 
Norris:
   Then bring this boy
   Serge to me, as soon
   as you find him.

 [Porre Soldier]
   Yes, sir!

Norris:
   Why, Sir Lynx!!!

Norris:
   Sir Lynx,
   where have you been
   all this time?
   We heard that you
   headed to Fort Dragonia
   with the general.
   Exactly what happened
   back there? There have
   been many strange
   occurrences since then.
   Perhaps you know of a
   boy named Serge?

Norris:
   ......!!!
   The man behind you is
   Acacia Dragoon Deva
   Karsh!!!
   Sir Lynx,
   you were in the middle
   of taking him into
   custody, sir?

Norris:
   ......!!!
   The man behind you is
   Acacia Dragoon Deva
   Zoah!!!
   Sir Lynx,
   you were in the middle
   of taking him into
   custody, sir?

   ...!!!

Norris:
   You are...
   me!?
   Wh-What is going on...?

Norris:
   Let's just say I
   am another you and
   leave it at that.
   Pardon me for saying this,
   but it appears that both
   of us need to look at
   the big picture.
   We will only have a
   limited understanding by
   staying in the same place.
   
Norris:
   S-Silence!

 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander Norris,
   there is an urgent message
   from command!

Norris:
   What is it?

 [Porre Soldier]
   Umm, sir, it is a level 2
   security message...

Norris:
   Go ahead, take no heed.
   This man is one of us.

 [Porre Soldier]
   Yes, sir!
   Grobyc has just arrived
   at the manor, sir.

Norris:
   Hmm...
   He is quite ahead of schedule.
   Understood, I will return ASAP.

 [Porre Soldier]
   Yes, sir!

Norris:
   Sir Lynx,
   forgive me, but I must return
   to the manor at once.
   Please come to the manor a
   little later.
   We will discuss this in more
   detail there.
 
 [Chapter]
Back to Viper Manor -
A captive audience awaits...

 [Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Sir Lynx,
   please go on through.
   
   Please go on through.
 
 [Riddel's Room, Viper Manor (Another)]
   
Porre Officer:
   Being stubborn, eh?

Porre Officer:
   I'm going to ask you one more time.
   What happened at Fort Dragonia!?
   Where is General Viper!?
   And where is the Frozen Flame!?

Riddel:
   I do not know.
   And even if I did,
   I would never tell you!

Porre Officer:
   Damn this goody-two-shoes...
   Listen up, missy, do you know
   what kind of predicament you're in!?

Norris:
   Please, sir, this woman
   has done nothing wrong.
   
Porre Officer:
   She is a prisoner of the Porre military.
   This is a legitimate interrogation!

Norris:
   I do not believe that, sir.
   There has to be a better way
   to go about this! Just give it
   a little more time and...

Porre Officer:
   We don't have the time, Norris!
   I have no time to be listening
   to your idealistic theories.

Porre Officer:
   Now, missy...
   Let's have you go
   down to the basement.

Norris:
   No, please!
   Wait!

Porre Officer:
   Norris!!!
   I've had enough of you for today.
   I want you to stay out of this!

Norris:
   ......

Porre Officer:
   Take her away!

 [Porre Soldier]
   Yes, sir!

Porre Officer:
   You disappoint me...
   Remain on standby
   in the parlor!

Porre Officer:
   I can't hear you!

Norris:
   Please, wait.
   Think of what you are doing.
   Can you live with that?

Porre Officer:
   He won't talk to you.
   He has no interest
   other than fighting.

Norris:
   This cannot be...
   Is he the one from the lab...?

Porre Officer:
   That's right.
   This is the Killing
   Machine Grobyc.
   
Grobyc:
   ......
   Grobyc-only-takes-orders
   from-those-who-are-stronger.

Porre Officer:
   Hah...!
   Another soldier
   who won't listen...
   
Porre Officer:
   Dismissed!

Porre Officer:
   Call in the cook!
   The '"hell"' one, of course...

 [Porre Soldier]
   Yes, sir!
 
 [Mess Hall, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
Orcha:
   WhatCHA makin' me
   cook the Porre
   soldiers food for!?
 
 [Library, Viper Manor (Another)]

Prophet:
   Hmmm...
   It appears that my worst
   fear has come true.
   You are Serge inside
   Lynx's body...
   
Prophet:
   You have come to rescue
   Riddel, have you not?
   
Prophet:
   I believe Riddel has been
   imprisoned in the basement.
   First, go and find Norris.
   He should be able to help you.

Prophet:
   Norris should be in the
   parlor on the first floor.
   
Prophet:
   First, go and find Norris.
   He should be in the parlor

 [Parlor, Viper Manor (Another)]
   
Norris:
   Sir Lynx!
   Please excuse these
   squalid conditions.
   
Norris:
   ......!!!

Norris:
   Who are you?
   Another me!?
   W-What is going on...?
   
Norris:
   Let's just say I
   am another you and
   leave it at that.
   Pardon me for saying this,
   but it appears that both
   of us need to look at
   the big picture.
   We will only have a
   limited understanding by
   staying in the same place.

Norris:
   S-Silence!

Norris:
   I am sorry...
   There is nothing
   I can do about it.
   
Norris:
   Sir...
   This has been bothering me
   since we met up in Termina.
   You seem different from
   what I last remember...
   You just seem...
   different...
   
Member:
   This man's
   not Lynx.
   
Norris:
   What?

Member:
   He may look like Lynx
   on the outside, but his spirit
   is that of Serge.
   
Norris:
   Is it true?
   Sir Lynx...
   What has happened?

Norris:
   I see...
   
Norris:
   So the Serge commanding
   the insurgent troops is
   the real Lynx...
   Everything is starting
   to make sense.

Norris:
   We were wrong all along.
   We never should have
   joined forces with Lynx...

Norris:
   And what brings
   you here?

Karsh:
   Riddel!!!
   Where is Lady Riddel!!!?
   Bring her out, NOW!!!
   You lay one filthy finger
   on her and you die!
   ARGHHHHHH!

Member:
   General Viper's
   daughter should
   be here.
   
Norris:
   I see...
   Then you are here
   to rescue her.

Norris:
   Understood.
   I would like to help.
   Riddel should be in
   the basement prison.
   Please, take this.

   the Prison Key!

Norris:
   There is a sewage system
   below the prison.
   You should be able to break
   into the prison by making
   your way through the sewers.
   Use the hatch downstairs.

Norris:
   The sewers are
   full of monsters.
   Please be alert, I have
   heard of one particularly
   frightful monster.

Norris:
   I will be in the 1F main hall.
   Please meet me there once
   you rescue Riddel.
   
Norris:
   You can access the
   sewage system from
   a hatch downstairs.

Norris:
   Let us meet up at the
   1F main hall after you
   rescue Riddel.
   
 [Kitchen, Viper Manor (Another)]

Orcha:

 [Porre Soldier]
   Your guest is waiting
   in the basement.
   
Hell Orcha:

 [Library, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
Prophet:
   Go down to the sewer
   system through a metal
   hatch on the B1 floor.

Prophet:
   After you rescue Riddel,
   come to me if you have
   any questions.
   
 [Luccia's Lab, Viper Manor (Another)]

   Do you really think
   Lynx would be here?
   
Fargo:
   He's right before
   me eyes, ain't he!?

Member:
   This isn't Lynx.
   He's Serge
   on the inside.
   
Fargo:
   You're pullin' me leg!

Fargo:
   Hmmm... It is strange
   that he'd be here...
   
Fargo:
   But I'm honored that
   you would come save me.
   I owe ya one.

Member:
   We're not here to
   rescue you.
   We're here to
   rescue General
   Viper's daughter.
   
Fargo:
   Oh, is that so.
   Well, you ended up
   savin' me anyway.
   Let me help.

Member:
   Do you know where
   General Viper's
   daughter is?
   
Fargo:
   Aye...!
   A young lass was taken
   to the cell next door.

Fargo:
   Well, how do we
   get outta here?

Member:
   Here's the key
   to the prison.
   
Fargo:
   Oh, great.

Fargo:
   I'm gonna go free the
   others and make me escape.
   Good luck to ya.

 [Dungeon, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
Porre Officer:
   This man is our secret
   weapon, Hell's Cook.

Riddel:
   You are the cook,
   Orcha!
   
Riddel:
   What have you
   done to him!?
   
Porre Officer:
   We had him eat some
   Quadffid seeds, found
   in Hydra Marshes.
   It has the power to
   release one's dark side.
   After that, we just ring
   a special bell and next
   thing you know, we have
   Hell's Cook, Orcha!

Riddel:
   How horrible...
   But why, Orcha...?

Porre Officer:
   We needed him to steal the
   Dragon's Tear from Guldove.
   Of course, his true self has
   no idea what he has done.
   
Porre Officer:
   Now prepare yourself!
   Who knows what this
   crazy man will do!

Riddel:
   NO!

Karsh:
   Lady Riddel!!!
   I have come to
   save you!

Porre Officer:
   You are...Sir Lynx.
   But why are you here?

Karsh:
   Actually, this man
   ain't Lynx!

Member:
   Actually, this man
   isn't Lynx!

Porre Officer:
   What...?

Member:
   It's too hard
   to explain.
   We're just here to
   take Riddel back.

Orcha:
   Mwa-CHA-CHA-CHA-CHA!
   Don'tCHA go interferin'
   with my cookin'!

Orcha:
   Actually, you'll make a
   fine ingredient for my soup!

Orcha:
   Let's get cookin'!!!
 
 [Porre Officer]
   What has happened, Sir Lynx?
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   The fun's just about to start.
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   Please continue cooking.
   
Riddel:
   Stop Orcha!

Orcha:
   Hurry it up or the
   ingredients will go bad!

Orcha:
   Resume cookin'!!!
   
Porre Officer:
   S-Sir Lynx
   has gone mad!!!

Member:
   I told you,
   he's not Lynx!
   
Orcha:
   Ughhh-CHA...
   I have a feelin' I've
   done somethin' terrible...
   
Orcha:
   They saw my gloatin' as a
   weakness and used me.
   I need more discipline...

Orcha:
   I wanna make it up to you.
   I wantCHA to take me with you.
   I wanna help...
   

 [Viper Manor]
 

 Norris:
   I will take it upon myself
   to make sure Riddel
   leaves the premises safely.

Norris:
   Please distract the soldiers
   while we make our escape.

Riddel:
   I would like to thank
   everyone from the bottom
   of my heart.
   I shall be heading to
   Hermit's Hideaway to
   take care of my father.
   Please be sure to stop by
   when you get the chance.

Karsh:
   Don't worry 'bout us.
   I'll make sure to wipe out
   all these Porre buffoons!
   
Riddel:
   Thank you...
   Karsh.
   
Member:
   What do you plan to
   do after all this?
   
Norris:
   I will be returning here.
   
Member:
   Then why don't you join
   us?
   
Norris:
   Thank you, I am honored.
   However, as a soldier of
   the Porre military, I cannot
   abandon my country or my men.

Norris:
   I will be fine.
   Thank you.

Norris:
   I wish you the best of luck.

Norris:
   When you get a chance,
   please come by and see
   me again, Norris...
   There is something
   I wish to give you.
   Good luck.

Norris:
   So you are the Norris
   from the other world.
   Please come by and see me
   when things settle down.
   There is something
   I wish to give you.
   Good luck.

Norris:
   We must hurry.

Riddel:
   Good-bye...

Member:
   We're completely
   surrounded...!

Member:
   It's not a good idea
   to leave now.
 
 [Porre Officer]
   Where might you be
   off to, Sir Lynx?

Member:
   I guess we can't
   talk our way out
   of this one...

 [Porre Officer]
   Seize them!!!

Grobyc:
   Show-Grobyc-your-skill.
 
 [Porre Officer]
   Where are you going?
   There is nowhere to run.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Follow the commander's orders.

 [Porre Soldier]
   You can't escape!
 
 [Porre Officer]
   Argh... Hmmm...
   Hey! You're up!

   There is a button that lowers
   the ladder inside the bookshelf.

Prophet:
   Hurry!
   You have little time!

 [Stablekeeper]
   What the...!?
   Where did you come from?
   
   Sir Lynx!
   Sounds like you ran into
   some trouble up there.
   
   What are you gonna do?
   The Porre soldiers are
   all over the place.

   ~~~Take 'em all on!
   ~~~Hehehehe...
   
   Don't be reckless, now.
   I have an idea.
   Leave it to me.

   Ohhh... That...!
   Hahahaha...
 
   This should be interesting...
   OK, leave it to me.

Norris:
   ......!!!

Norris:
   Who are you?
   Another me!?
   W-What is going on...?

Norris:
   Let's just say I
   am another you and
   leave it at that.
   Pardon me for saying this,
   but it appears that both
   of us need to look at
   the big picture.
   We will only have a
   limited understanding by
   staying in the same place.

Norris:
   S-Silence!

Norris:
   I am sorry...
   There is nothing
   I can do about it.
   You are a Norris
   from another world.
 
Norris:
   Please bring the Norris
   from your world, here.
   There is something
   I wish to give him.
 
Norris:
   Please take this,
   Norris...
   I no longer need it.

   TopShot!

Norris:
   We have decided to
   withdraw from here.
   We shall be returning to
   the mainland in due time.

Norris:
   I must be off.

Luccia:
   You are not Lynx, but
   Serge, correct?
   I am sorry, but I do not
   know vot you must do
   to regain your true form.
   
Luccia:
   If the Dragon's Tear
   has anyt'ing to do
   vith it...
   You may be able to
   find something out
   in Guldove.

 [Right Tower, Viper Manor (Another)]

   There's a letter inside.
 
 [Letter]
   There's a good reason why
   we borrowed the contents.

   If you want it back, come

Prophet:
   The Porre soldiers
   have withdrawn from
   Viper Manor.
   
Prophet:
   You cannot continue
   in that form forever,

   Perhaps if you return to
   Fort Dragonia, where
   all of this happened,
   you may be able to
   regain your true form.

Karsh:
   Hey, gramps...
   
Marcy:
   No, Radius.
   He's not Sir...
   I mean he's not Lynx.
   
Radius:
   So you mean to tell me
   that you are really
   Serge...?

Radius:
   Hmmm...
   This is hard to take in so
   suddenly, but I do not sense
   Lynx's evil within you...
   
Radius:
   Hmmm...
   So this is the me
   from the other world.

Radius:
   I expected nothing but
   the best. You have brilliant
   skills, just like me...
   
Radius:
   Hmph, that's my line.
   You have brilliant skills
   like mine to have been
   able to block like that.
   
Radius:
   Hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!!!

Radius:
   Hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh!!!
   
Zoah:
   WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
   THEY WILL FIND YOU
   IF YOU LEAVE NOW.

Karsh:
   Where do you think you're
   going? They'll find us for
   sure if we leave now.
   
Zoah:
   I AM NOT USED TO
   BEING PURSUED...
   
Radius:
   I heard what happened.
   I just couldn't believe it
   until I saw it with my own eyes.
   Oh, and thank you for
   saving Miss Riddel.
   I am very grateful.

Radius:
   General Viper's wound
   is healing nicely,
   thanks to Marcy nursing
   him back to health.
   The general should be up
   and about by tomorrow.
   
Karsh:
   Rrrrargh!!!
   Those Porre jokers
   piss me off!!!
   At least we were able
   to save Lady Riddel.
   But still, one of these days,
   I'll kick every one of them
   out of our manor!
   
Riddel:
   Thank you kindly for
   everything, Serge.
   I have heard much of
   what has happened.
   We cannot allow Lynx
   to carry on like this.
   I owe you a debt of
   gratitude, so I would like
   to fight alongside you.
   I may be inexperienced
   in battle, but I hope
   you will find me helpful.


Riddel:
   You seem very tired.
   I do recommend that
   you rest.

Riddel:
   Would you like to rest?
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No
   
Marcy:

Marcy:

Harle:

Harle:

Member:
   Wait, Serge!
   
Kid:
   Oi, Lynx!!!
   Today's the day
   I finish you off!

Member:
   Are you alright!?
   She's quite serious.
   And...I have a bad
   feeling about this...
   She doesn't seem
   to be herself...
   
Serge:
   Heh heh heh...
   Yes...she is indeed Kid.
   However, right now, you
   are the one who is Lynx.
   And I am Serge.
   Once our roles were reversed,
   so were our problems.
   To her, killing you
   will avenge Lucca.

Serge:
   Right, Kid?
   
Kid:
   Yeah, I'll put an
   end to Lynx today...
   and avenge Lucca!!!

Member:
   I think we'd better
   retreat for now.
   
Serge:
   Give it up.
   We have this shack
   completely surrounded.
   There's no way
   you can escape.

   talk with Serge..
   
Fargo:
   Tch...

Viper:
   Serge, Lynx has headed
   to the Sea of Eden.
   We must do everything in our
   power to prevent him from
   obtaining the Frozen Flame.
   I shall lend a hand.
   We must put a stop to him.
   
   
Fargo:
   Arg...
   What the hell...

Fargo:
   Aye, Serge!
   I'll help ya out, too.
   Ya saved me life
   twice already.
   And, I guess I already
   know too much.
   I can't just sit around
   and ignore the situation.
 
   
Fargo:
   Viper!
   I'll deal with ya later.
   Once we put an end to this
   situation, you're mine!

Viper:

Zoah:
   I, TOO, WOULD LIKE TO HELP.
   THERE IS NO POINT IN MY
   NOT FIGHTING.
   PLUS, YOU SAVED MISS RIDDEL.
   ACCEPT THIS GESTURE AS A
   TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION.

   
Karsh:
   Hah! There ain't no way
   I'm backin' outta this.
   And since you saved
   Lady Riddel,
   I've decided to
   help you out.
   Please, just a thank you

Member:
   Can't we go

Member:

   Zis used to be ze only
   entrance to ze Sea of Eden.
   However, legend sayz, no one
   haz been able to see it or

   we supposed
   to get in?

Harle:
   You need ze powerz of ze
   Dragonz zat sealed ze flame.
   You must break ze seal of
   ze Pearly Gates with2 relics
   from each of ze 6 Dragonz.

Member:

   You mean here?

Harle:
   Non. Ze true gate to ze

Harle:
   You will find zem

   you will not be able to make
   it inside az Monsieur Lynx.

Member:
   Then what are
   we supposed
   to do?
   
Harle:
   Ze Dragon Tear...
   Zat iz all I can

   Now, it'z my turn to

   What should we
   do now?
   At this rate
   we won't be
   able to borrow
   the Dragon Tear.
 
Member:
   Speaking of
   the Dragon Tear...
   Shouldn't we return
   the broken tear to
   the shrine in
   the other world?
   The shaman in the other
   world might be able to
   help us somehow.

   Let's go find out what's up.

Member:
   Porre soldiers!?
   In a small village
   like this!?

Member:
   But something's odd.
   And who's that lady?
 
 [Porre Officer]
   Y-You dare to resist
   the Porre military!?

Orlha:
   So what if I resist?
   Why don't you stop hiding
   behind your men and try to
   stop me yourself?

 [Porre Officer]
   I-I'll make you regret that!
   A-Alright, you, GO!
   Seize th-this girl.

 [Porre Soldier]
   Wh-Why me, sir?

 [Porre Officer]
   Arrgh, don't talk back!
   This is a direct order!
   Get with it, on the double!!!
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Y-You heard us.
   C-Cease your r-resistance.
   A woman should...be more gentle
   a-and lady-like...
   
Orlha:
   There, that'll teach you
   a lesson, o great soldier-man!
   Or do you need another round?   
  
 [Porre Officer]
   ~!!!~

   Why, isn't this Sir Lynx?
   We cannot arrest
   this girl on our own.
   Please help us, sir!
   
Orlha:
   There are more of you?
   But you're still no match for me.
   Leave this village now!

Orlha:
   ...Running away?
   If you call yourself a soldier,
   you'll fight till the bitter end!

   You've got no choice but to fight!!!

   Wait! I order you and
   your troops to return
   to headquarters.
   We will take care
   of this girl.
   This village will
   be under Sir Lynx's
   command until
   further notice.
   Report that back to
   high command.
   
 [Porre Officer]
   But that will be too much
   trouble for...

Member:
   Didn't you hear?
   This is an order from
   your superior officer.
   If you disobey, you will
   be court-martialed.
   Do I make myself
   clear?
   
 [Porre Officer]
   Y-Yes, sir!
   We will gather the troops
   and head back to headquarters
   at once, sir!
 
 [Doc's House, Guldove (Another)]
 
Doc:
   I cannot believe it...
   Is it possible that such a
   thing can occur...?

Orlha:
   ...You say that you
   are really Serge?
   Even though you are
   in a different body?
   I don't know what happened...
   but you need to get back
   your true self.
   
Doc:
   Hey, even you should not
   get up so soon.
   ...Are you alright?
   Even though you are a trained
   fighter, you should refrain from
   pushing yourself too hard.

Orlha:
   I'll be fine...
   But I almost bit the
   big one this time.
   Ha ha...
   Looks like I'm in need of
   more training...
   Ooo, that hurts...
   
Orlha:
   As proof that you are really
   Serge when you regain your
   self, I will lend you this brooch.

Member:
   Serge received the
   SapphireBrooch.
   
Doc:
   Orlha!?
   Is that your sister's...?

Orlha:
   It's alright...for now.
   Listen, Serge.
   Promise me this.
   When you successfully regain
   your true self, come visit me.
   I will gladly aid you then...
   
Doc:
   Even though I understand what
   happened logically, emotionally,
   I haven't straighten things out.
   I am sorry, Serge..
   Please give me a little more time.
   I would be just a burden to
   you in this state, man.

 [Orlha's Bar, Guldove (Another)]
 
Orlha:
   I have a twin sister.
   Her name is Tia...

Orlha:
   According to old legends,
   '"Twins are signs of tragedy..."'
   When I was a child, I was
   separated from my mother and
   sister, who left El Nido...
   I only had my father.
   I felt as if half of my
   body had been lost.
   There was a huge
   void in my heart...

Orlha:
   Chuckle... I never told this
   story to anyone before...
   Strange.
   Sometimes I really feel that
   there are countless worlds...
   And I am not the only me...
   Does this sound odd?

Orlha:
   But that might just be
   running away from reality...

Orlha:
   The one thing that always
   helped me when I felt weak was
   this sapphire brooch...
   It is a token that's been passed
   down through generations in
   my family.
   It is cracked in half now; one half
   belongs to me, and the other to
   my sister Tia...

Orlha:
   You don't have to return it...
   just yet.
   This blue gem... This is the only
   one that exists in this world.
   That means it is proof
   you are the real '"Serge."'

Orlha:
   So, please keep it with you
   until you have regained
   your true identity.
   
Orlha:
   This blue gem is a token of the
   promise between you and me...
   Don't forget, Serge..
   
Orlha:
   Someday, I will find
   my sister, Tia...
   Somewhere, somehow...
 
 [Chief's Tent, Guldove (Another)]
 
Direa:
   How can this be?
   This is without doubt, a
   piece of the Dragon Tear...
   Serge, I shall bestow upon
   you the Dragon Emblem.
   It is the symbol of a
   Dragon shaman.

   DragonEmblem.

Direa:
   The emblem and the Dragon Tear
   have been handed down by
   Dragon shamans for generations.
   Although the worlds are
   different, you should be able
   to receive aid from the other
   shaman with this emblem.
   Make haste to the
   alternate world.
 
 [Isle of the Damned (Another)]
 
Peppor:
   I-If you want to
   shake it on past us...

Solt:
   You most definitely must
   bring Karsh here!
 
Peppor:
   S-Sir Karsh...!
   Y-You actually shook it here!

Solt:
   Do you knowingly know
   why we are here...?

Karsh:
   Hell NO!
   WHAT!?
   Am I supposed to...!?

Peppor:
   Don't shake ignorance!
   
Solt:
   We came to investigate
   what happened here!!!

Karsh:
   ......!!!
   
Peppor:
   Sir Karsh!
   W-We have stood by your
   side, unable to shake loose
   this one suspicion we had...

Karsh:
   Suspicion...!?

Solt:
   We believe you may
   have killed Sir Dario!
   
Peppor:
   And by shaking it here,
   our suspicion has
   turned to conviction!
   S-Sir Karsh...
   We are executing you for
   the murder of Sir Dario!

Karsh:
   Dario...
 
 [Flashback, Termina (Another)]
   
Riddel:
   How is your training going,
   everyone?
   
Dario:
   Miss Riddel!

Riddel:
   I brought something special
   for everyone today...

Glenn:
   Oh, really?
   What is it, what is it?
   Viper Churros?

Riddel:
   Wrong answer, Glenn.
   Next?
   Are they really that
   good?

Glenn:
   Uh-huh!
   I can chomp down ten
   of those easily!

Dario:
   Hahaha...
   You're always like that.
   Those churros were originally
   iron rations for knights.
   Overeating is not good
   discipline.

Dario:
   So, Miss Riddel,
   what have you brought us?
   Please don't make us
   hold our breath too long.

Riddel:
   This is it!
   I found it in Fossil Valley.
   Isn't it pretty?

Glenn:
   Ah shoot, it's just a flower!

Dario:
   Miss Riddel,
   did you go to the
   valley by yourself...?

Riddel:
   What, I'm not allowed to?
   It's just the valley,
   I'm sure it's safe enough.
   
Dario:
   ......

Riddel:
   I have enough for
   everyone; I will
   give some to you boys!
   Glenn doesn't want any,
   right?

Glenn:
   Since you've gone through the
   trouble of getting it, I'll
   take one, too!
   If I plant its seeds,
   I might get some good fruit
   from it!
   
Riddel:
   Oh, how silly of you, Glenn!

Riddel:
   Here you go, Glenn.
   But I don't think it will
   grow any fruit, though.

Glenn:
   You don't know until you try!

Riddel:
   Karsh might not like things
   like flowers, but...
   
Karsh:
   ......
   N-No, it's not that...

Dario:
   You brought me one, too.
   This is beautiful...
   What kind of flower
   could this be?
   
Riddel:
   It is a '"bellflower."'
   
Dario:
   Miss Riddel, if you ever
   wish for this flower,
   I will go for you instead.
   If anything should happen
   to you...

Riddel:
   Then let us go together.
   Does that sound like a
   good idea?

Dario:
   ......
   Yes, very well.
 
 [Flashback Two, Termina (Another)]
 
Dario:
   ...Karsh?
   Are you listening?

Karsh:
   Huh...?
   Oh, sorry.
   So what is it?
   What's with the formality?

Dario:
   ...U-Umm.
   How should I...
   Actually, I...

Karsh:
   Why are ya acting so strange?
   Spit it out...

Dario:
   ...A-Ay.
   To tell you the truth...

Riddel:
   Karsh,
   we are pledged to marry.
   I have already told
   daddy about it...

Dario:
   Th-That is what I wanted
   to tell you...
   Will you bless us
   with your approval,
   Karsh?

Karsh:
   ...?
   Marry...?
   S-So that's it!
   Well, congratulations!
   So when's it gonna be,
   and where?

Dario:
   We haven't decided on a
   date yet.
   We still need to finish surveying
   the Isle of the Damned, first.
   It's just that...

Karsh:
   Just what...?

Dario:
   I want the wedding here.
   The place where we have
   cried together, laughed
   together, and shared our
   dreams...together.

Karsh:
   Grin
   You never change, Dario.
   Hey, then I'll have to fill
   this dull vacant lot with
   loads of bellflowers.
   Just tell me if I can
   help ya in any way.

Dario:
   ...Thank you,
   Karsh.
 
 [Flashback Three, Isle of the Damned (Another)]
 
Karsh:
   This must be it!
   
Dario:
   Karsh, why are you
   in such a hurry?
   The enemy is not going
   anywhere, and the
   footing here is bad...

Karsh:
   Why do you always have
   to be like that, Dario?
   The Masamune
   may be in there!
   Any dragoon would be
   hyped to see that thing!
   You know!?
   
Dario:
   ......
   
Karsh:
   Shaker Brothers,
   you stay here.
 
Solt:
   Sir!
   
Peppor:
   S-Sir!

Karsh:
   Let's get goin',
   Dario.
   
Dario:
   Fine...
   
 [Flashback Four, Termina (Another)]
 
Karsh:
   Is that...
   the Masamune!?
   
Karsh:
   Was I really just possessed
   by that devilish sword...?
   Driven by such intense hatred
   and envy...?
   Maybe deep inside me, I was
   filled with hatred?
   Dario, the one whom I could
   never beat, no matter how much
   I tried...the one who stole
   Riddel's heart from me...

Karsh:
   What if that sword does
   not imbed hatred into
   the mind of its wielder...
   but instead draws out and
   ignites the flames of hatred
   hidden within the hearts
   of men...?
   And if that hatred was
   something deep within the
   wielder to begin with...?

   Then what have I...?

 [Glenn]
   ......
   
 [Isle of the Damned (Another)]
 
Peppor:
   S-So you do know
   something about it!

Karsh:
   Take it easy...!
   Why the hell do I have
   to fight you guys!?

Solt:
   No time for questions!

Karsh:
   Tch!
   What the hell!?
   
Peppor:
   R-Running away!?

Solt:
   Makes him look even more
   suspiciously suspicious!

Karsh:
   Listen, I don't
   wanna fight you!!!
 
   Axiomatic!

Karsh:
   Listen to me...
   I did not kill Dario...
   I know the time will come
   when I can speak the truth.
   But I can't just yet...
   I hope you understand.
   
Peppor:
   Sir Karsh...!
   I have come to an understanding
   after that battle we just had...
   You are not an evil person.
   You would never kill your
   best friend!
   Please forgive us...
   Looking back now, you were
   the one who took us under
   your wing, even though we
   were dragoon outcasts.
   You are very special to us,
   Sir Karsh!

Solt:
   Sob...!
   We believe you,
   Sir Karsh...!
   We must be on our way,
   but we hope to see you again,
   sometime, somewhere...
   When that time comes, we hope
   you will be readily ready to
   tell us what really happened!

Peppor:
   A-And...
   We're sorry we
   took this from you.
   We're shaking it
   back to you.

   MementoPendant!
   
Karsh:
   ...Thanks.
   I'll take good care of it.
   One day, I promise to
   tell you guys the truth...
   Take care.

   Nooo!!!

   But that's the hardest part.
   I wonder if there's anyone
   out there who can convince him?
   If so...
   it would have to be someone
   with a genuine heart, like
   the father I used to know.

   ~ come to an end... ~

   Yesterday's friends become
   ~~ tomorrow's foes... ~~

   with betrayal and enmity...

   Once one reaches the summit,
       all that remains is one's    
   ~    inevitable downfall...   

   ~   All has become lost...   ~
       The innumerable wounds,    
     once decorations of glory,  
   have begun instead to ache...
   
   Aaah, have I awoken...?
   Where might I be...?

   Could this be the Grave of
   the Narwhales that is said
   to lie hidden in the seas?
 
   Where am I!?

   So...I am all alone.
   Just deserts for
   the likes of me...

   in whom I trusted...
   Gone are the friends with
   whom I shared my dreams...

   tell one so fair...

 [Miki]
   If thou wishest not to speak
   of such things, I shan't force
   thee to tell them unto me.
   Instead, kind sir, may I
   inquire as to the world
   from which thou comest...?
  
    Enough!
    That shall suffice.
    What a wretched,

    Thou needest not fight
    e'ermore.

   thou comest lacks any
   form of pleasure.

 [Nikki]
   Pleasure...?
   
 [Miki]
   ~~Dear sailorman...
   ~~Let me hear the song
   ~~that thou dost like best!
   ~~A splendid song from a
   ~~far-away world, unknown
   ~~to the likes of me...
   
 [Nikki]
   A song...?
   Of such a thing I
   know naught...
   Wherefore wouldst thou
   hear my croonings,
   Neptunian nymph?
   Surely there is naught
   to be gained from it!?
   
 [Miki]
    What a poor,
    miserable man thou art!
    Songs be the soul's
    delight...
   
   ~~When one is sad, songs
   ~~gently envelope one's
   ~~sorrows...
   ~~And when one is happy,
   ~~songs are there to
   ~~share the joy with thee.
   
   That be the very
   essence of song!
   
 [Nikki]
   So thou sayest...
   Unfortunately, singing
   has no relevance to me.
   I long ago forgot how to
   laugh and how to cry.
   
   How awfully nostalgic!?
   I feel as though I have
   heard that song before,
   somewhere, long ago.
   
   A mysterious melody
   that bathes thee in
   a warm glow...
   
 [Miki]
   It is a precious song,
   handed down generation
   to generation on my island.
   It seems to have reached
   the heart of thee, who
   knows not of song...

   Now make me a promise...
   Repay me for saving you by
   singing this song for me.
   
 [Nikki]
   Hold on!
   Such a thing
   I cannot do!
   
 [Miki]
   '"Cannot"' is different
   from '"will not!"'
   Please promise to grant
   this one petition!
   
 [Nikki]
   Wait!
   Do not go!
   
   Sigh...!
   As I thought...
   I am unable to
   perform such music!
   
 [Nymph]
   Thou seem troubled...
   
   Who might ye be?
 
 [Nymph]
   Our sister shan't
   come out again until
   thou singest!
 
 [Nikki]
   Please, I beg ye!
   Teach me how to sing.

 [Nymph]
   Music and song are not
   something that thou
   canst teach or learn.
   They are things that
   thou must feel!

   First try playing
   the notes.

   That is terrible!
   'Tis void of all
   emotion!
 
   Thou dost need not to be
   a bard, so long as thou 
   express thy feelings.
   The thoughts of thy
   heart that words cannot
   express...
   Let thy instrument
   tell us what thou
   want to say...

   'Tis better...
   Keep it up...

   Thou art a kind man.
   We can tell from the
   sound thou makest...

   Hehee...Thou hast got it!
   Aye...'Tis becoming fun!

 [Nikki]
   Well...
   What dost thou think?

 [Miki]
   'Tis beautiful!
   Each note enwraps
   my very soul...
   
   If ever thou art
   sorrowed and at the
   limits of despair...
   
   Then croon this song
   and remember, dear,
   this very moment...
   The time when our
   hearts began to beat
   to one rhythm...
   And know that our
   song will continue on
   forever more...

 [Nikki]
   Lo! The stars doth
   twinkle in accord
   with our song...

   The brighter one is the
   Star of Diarmuid...
   And next to it the Star
   of Grania can be seen
   shining so faintly...
   We mariners navigate
   our vessels by these
   two stars!
 
 [Miki]
   Thou art a knowledgable
   man! I naught knew the
   names of such luminaries.
   I just saw them as
   jewels that shine
   in the night sky...

 [Nikki]
   I didn't realize that
   stars could look so
   beautiful...
   I never took the time
   to gaze at them like
   this before...
   Nor ever heard the
   song that they had
   been singing unto me.

   Now that I have spent
   what seems like days
   singing here with thee...
   I have come to realize
   that there is more than
   what seems be...

   The twinkling of the stars...
   The waving of the waves...
   Even silence itself...
   All sing in harmony
   with thee and me.
 
 [Miki]
   'Tis strange to think
   that both thy world and
   mine share the same stars.

 [Nikki]
   Speaking of which,
   I must soon return
   to my world.
 
 [Miki]
   Wherefore, dear sir?
   Thou dost not like
   it here?
 
 [Nikki]
   My pursuers are nigh...
   My staying here will
   endanger thy folk...

 [Miki]
   Then allow me to come
   with thee, sweet sir.

 [Nikki]
   I cannot allow such a
   thing!
   One step out of here lie
   treacherous tempests
   and woeful warfare.

   Yet, even then...

   Even then, thou dost
   say thou shalt come
   with me?

 [Miki]
   I know that for a
   certainty...
   Yet for this place only
   to have peace while the
   whole world is at war
   is a selfishness itself.

   Perhaps the love we
   share can be shared
   with the whole world.
   Both nature and mankind
   must surely desire to
   live hand-in-hand...
 
 [Nikki]
   Then comest thou to me,
   my sweet sea sprite...

   Until the whole world
   hath come to live in
   heavenly harmony...
   Upon that day shall
   I bring thee back to
   this idyllic isle.

   Then...
   Then and only then...

   Will both our worlds
   have peace between
   nature and humanfolk...
   And resonate in chorus
   with our anthem dear.

   Together, let us
   build that whole
   new world...

   Come my maiden,
   come...!

   ......

Fargo:
   Oh, Zelbess...
   Does this song call
   out to your heart?
   You taught me
   this song...
   For a long time, I've been
   trying to regain what
   I've lost, but to no avail...
   But now...
   I feel as if the one important
   thing has finally returned...
   Thanks to the irreplaceable
   treasure you left behind.

Fargo:
   So you're happy for me, too...
 
 [SS Zelbess (Home)]
 
Fargo:
   Even though she
   said that...
   I, too, was unable to
   fulfill the promise
   I made Zelbess...
   Her dream is
   also my dream...
   Zelbess...
   I promised never to use
   this attack again, but
   there is no avoiding it...
   Please forgive me...
   This time, I will protect you!

   Invincible!

Fargo:
   Alright then...!!!
   I'll show you how
   serious I can get!
   It's time for me to
   let loose in Marbule!

   Y-Yo, guys...!!!
   I'm sure you've noticed,
   but something a-ain't right...
   I-I-I know they're harmless,
   but they've grown in numbers!
   If these monsters are
   somebody's bad dream...
   then...whose...?
   O-Or what's...?
   Dream...? Then does that
   mean that if these monsters
   die, someone or something
   will wake up?
   
Ash:
   I bet the dreamer is
   10 times as nasty as
   this nightmare.
   It's probably some big,
   huge, gnarly dragon!
   
Ash:
   S-Sir Toma!
   I think we're about
   done here!
   
The Great Explorer Toma:
   Uhh... Err... Yeah...
   Well, I think I'm through
   with my investigation here...
   Don't get the wrong idea...
   It's not that I'm scared
   or anything!
   Well, take care.

   in the far-off distance...

Nikki:
   Thank you...
   Words cannot express
   how I feel inside...
   This event has allowed me
   to see myself differently.
   I hope to share this feeling
   with not only humans, but
   with all living creatures...
   
Nikki:
   What a surpise to see
   you here, Miki.
   You never come here.

Miki:

Nikki:

   WHAT-EVER!

Nikki:

Nikki:
   Thank you for opening my
   father's eyes to reality...
   I'm sure Marbule will
   thrive with beauty again.
   When that day comes, I would
   like to perform there again...

Fargo:
   No, Nikki... I'm the one
   who needs to give thanks.
   She's also a manifestation
   of myself. That's why I'm able
   to understand her feelings...
   But I can't keep that feeling
   bottled up forever. That's
   what she helped me realize.
   All thanks to you...

   Oh, it's you...
   I always get like this
   after a gig, you know...
   Pretty sad sight, ain't it?
   A grown woman, moping
   around like a little girl...
   I know our gig is
   just a show, but I do
   have feelings for him...
   Anyway, we're on vacation now,
   so why not take me with you?

   Welcome...

   Yes, if it is your wish,

   I am you, and you are also me.
   No need to think too deeply;
   it's just a fact of life.

Orcha:
   There are sure some fascinatin'
   things in this world...
   To think that I'd come

   ...It might just be my imagination,

 [Glenn and Dario's House, Termina (Another)]

Glenn:
   Sir Lynx...?
   Exactly what happened
   up there in the fort?

Glenn:
   Miss Riddel...
   I am at a loss for what
   to believe...
   I plan to leave the Dragoons
   for a while...
   
Riddel:
   I understand...
   But please, do not put
   yourself into danger...
   Everyone in the Dragoons
   is worried about your
   safety...
   
Glenn:
   ......
   
Glenn:
   General...
   I...
   I am deeply sorry for
   my selfish conduct.
   I am prepared for expulsion
   from the Dragoons...

Viper:
   What are you saying, Glenn.
   I am the one who needs to
   apologise.
   Like your brother Dario, you
   have the same calm eyes that
   see the big picture without
   being led astray.
   And that is exactly what the
   Dragoons are in need of now...

Glenn:
   General...

Karsh:
   Glenn,
   come on, let's go!
   We need as many hands
   as possible right now!

Glenn:
   Sorry,
   Karsh...
   but I cannot follow the
   Dragoons now.
   I need some time to
   think on my own...

Karsh:
   Heh, you're beginning to
   sound similar to your
   big bro!

Glenn:
   Master Zappa...

Zappa:
   Glenn, ye're alright.
   Ah no can tell ye how
   relieved ah am!

Glenn:
   Sir Radius...
   Sometimes I can not tell
   right from wrong.
   Right now, I do not know what
   is going on or what I can do
   about it... What would Dario
   do if he were here...
   
Radius:
   Hoh hoh hoh...!
   There is no need to worry.
   It seems Dario's spirit lives
   strongly within you.
   Believe in yourself and do what
   you believe.
 
 [Forbidden Island (Home)]
 
Man:
   Yes?
   
Radius:
   Impossible!

   Is it really you!?
   What the...!?
   So you're actually alive
   in this world!

Viper:
   Impossible!
   Is that you, Dario!?
   This is remarkable...
   So you are alive
   in this world.

Marcy:
   No way!
   Are you Dario!?
   You're alive...
   Of course you are!
   You're Dario!
   
Luccia:
   You...
   Are you Dario?
   So you are alive
   in dis vorld.
   yes, it all makes
   perfect sense.
   
Zoah:
   D-DARIO!
   YOU ARE ALIVE
   IN THIS WORLD!
   
Radius:
   Dario!
   I don't believe this...

Karsh:
   Dario!
   That's right...
   We're in another world.

   Dario, it is you!
   So, you are alive...

Marcy:
   Hey, it's Dario!
   I knew Dario
   couldn't die!

   yes, it makes sense dat
   you vould be alive
   in anotter vorld.

   know who I am?

   DO YOU NOT KNOW
   WHO YOU ARE?
 
 [Woman]

   It has been 4 years
   since this man washed
   ashore, clinging on
   for dear life.

   Every day was a battle
   between life and death, but
   miraculously, he made it.

   However, this man has
   no recollection of his
   past whatsoever...
   
Glenn:
   Impossible!
   Brother!
   But how...!?
   I understand...
   You are alive in this world.
   
Radius:
   Hmmm...
   Well, it was a miracle
   that he survived...
   I guess this cannot be helped.
   
Riddel:
   This cannot be...
   Are you...Dario!?
   But of course you are.
   This is another world.
   You are alive and well
   in this world!

Karsh:
   Dario!
   I'm your buddy Karsh!
   Don't you remember!?

Viper:
   Good lord!
   So you do not
   remember a thing?

Marcy:
   C'mon!
   You don't remember me?

Luccia:
   A case of amnesia
   resulting from his injuries.
   Dis could be bad.

Zoah:
   THIS IS TERRIBLE...
   
Dario:
   Forgive me...
   I just cannot remember.
   
Glenn:
   Brother!
   You are alive!
   
Radius:
   What can we do?
   Yes!
   Perhaps he will remember if
   we bring Riddel here.

Karsh:
   Damn...!
   What can we do?
   Hey!
   What if we bring
   Lady Riddel here?
   He might remember then!
   
Riddel:
   What did you say!?
   No, this cannot be...
   
Viper:
   What can we do?
   Yes, my daughter, Riddel,
   may help him remember!
   
Marcy:
   So, like, what can we do?
   Oh yeah!
   Maybe he'll remember if
   we bring Riddel here!

   Somet'ing to stimulate
   his memory...
   yes, perhaps if ve
   bring Riddel here...
   
Glenn:
   Brother!
   Don't you remember me!?
   I am your brother, Glenn!

   WHAT CAN WE DO?
   AHA! YES!
   HE MAY REMEMBER IF WE
   BRING MISS Riddel HERE.
   
Dario:
   My name is Dario...?
   
Riddel:
   This cannot be...
   Are you...Dario!?
   But of course you are.
   This is another world.
   You are alive and well
   in this world!

Dario:
   You seem to know
   me quite well.
   
Riddel:
   Yes, Dario.
   You do not remember me?
   I may be the Riddel
   from another world, but
   every day, I have always...
   And yet you do not
   remember who I am?

Dario:
   Riddel...?
   That name moves my heart...
   I have a feeling I have lost
   someone very dear to me...
   
Riddel:
   If only there was something
   to reawaken your memory...
   Yes, I know.
   Your mother's memento
   which you gave to me...
   That may help you remember.
   
Riddel:
   Daddy!
   
Viper:
   Oh, that...
   I could not stand seeing
   you in such sorrow,
   so I stored it in the
   secret treasure vault
   inside the manor.
   
Riddel:
   The secret treasure vault?
   You mean the one inside
   the east tower?
   
Viper:
   Indeed. You should be able
   to access that room from
   the 2nd floor, now.

Riddel:
   But wait.
   The Shaker Brothers made
   off with the contents
   of that treasure chest.

Viper:
   Those fools...
   I guess there is no choice
   but to bring Karsh to
   the Isle of the Damned.

Riddel:
   I believe that was...
   My father could not stand
   seeing me in sorrow...
   So he stored it safely
   away in a secret treasure
   vault inside Viper Manor.
   
Member:
   A secret treasure vault?
   Where exactly is it?
 
Riddel:
   It is in a room inside
   the east tower.
   You can access it
   from the 2nd floor.

Riddel:
   But wait.
   The Shaker Brothers made
   off with the contents
   of that treasure chest.

Karsh:
   Damn, those idiots...
   I guess I'd better make my way
   down to the Isle of the Damned.

Member:
   Looks like we'd
   better head to
   the Isle of the Damned.
 
 [Woman]
   Doesn't everyone have things in
   the past they wish to forget?
   Please, do not torment him
   any further...

   We live a quiet life here.
   Please...leave us alone.
 
Member: 
  It's useless
  unless Riddel
  shows it to him.
   
Dario:
   You seem to know
   me quite well.
   
Riddel:
   Yes, Dario.
   You do not remember me?
   I may be the Riddel
   from another world, but
   every day, I have always...
   And yet you do not
   remember who I am?
   
Dario:
   Riddel...?
   That name moves my heart...
   I have a feeling I have lost
   someone very dear to me...
   
Riddel:
   This pendant is a memento
   from your mother...
   and a gift you gave me
   when we got engaged.
   
Dario:
   This is...

Riddel:
   Try to remember!
   We have been together
   since we were little.
   And we will continue to be...
   I will always be there
   for you, Dario...

Dario:
   Riddel...
   R-Run...
   
Dario:
   Aaaaaaargh!
 
 [Garai]
   Riddel...
   Riddel...
   That's right... Riddel...
   
Radius:
   Th-This is bad!
 
 [Woman]
   W-What...?
   What's wrong?
   
Radius:
   No!
   Don't touch him!
 
 [Woman]
   AHHHHHH!
   
Karsh:
   What the...!?

Karsh:
   The Masamune!

Glenn:
   Brother, what are
   you talking about!?

Riddel:
   Dario!

Riddel:
   No, Dario!
   Do not touch that sword!

 [Garai]
   Riddel...
   Mine sword thirsts for your blood...
   
Radius:
   I knew it!
   The Masamune never actually
   disappeared from Death Gate.
   It just returned to its
   rightful owner.

Karsh:
   Wait a minute!
   Then that means Dario's still...

Radius:
   What really happened!?
   I thought Dario died
   fighting demons on the
   Isle of the Damned!?
   
Karsh:
   Actually...
 
 [Flashback, Isle of the Damned (Another)]
 
Karsh:
   Is that...
   the Masamune!?

Karsh:
   Dario!?
   What do you think
   you're doing!?

 [Dario]
   ......
   DIE!

   to all living
   creatures!!!
   
Karsh:
   Don't tell me it's
   that sword...!?
   Dario, let go!!!
   
 [Dario]
   Tch...!
   
Karsh:
   Stop, Dario!!!
   It's me!
   Karsh!

   Damn!
   
Dario:
   Kill me, Karsh!
   Hurry...!

Karsh:
   N-No...!

Dario:
   Do it, Karsh!!!
   Or else, I'll...!

Karsh:
   No, Dario!
   I can't!
   Please snap out
   of it, Dario!!!

 [Garai]
   Heh-heh-heh...
   You idiot.
   I gave you a chance...

   You cannot beat me...

   You are but a mere mortal...

Karsh:
   Who the...!?
   
 [Garai]
   First, I will dispose
   of you, and then...

   Riddel...

   I shall let the Masamune
   sate itself on
   Riddel's blood....

   Heh-heh-heh...!
   HAH-HAH-HAH...!

Karsh:
   DAMN YOU...!
   AHHHHHH...!!!

Karsh:
   Dario...!!!
   What have I done...?
 
 [Garai]
   Pathetic fool...

Karsh:
   Y-You are...

Lynx:
   Dario was killed
   by demons.
   Understand, Karsh?
   
Karsh:
   But...

Lynx:
   Are you going to tell
   everyone about what
   you just did?
   Are you willing to tell
   Riddel that YOU murdered
   Dario because he was possessed
   by the Evil Sword...?
   
Karsh:
   ......!

Lynx:
   Do not worry.
   Do as I say, and everything
   will be just fine.

 [Karsh]
   Dario...
 
 [Forbidden Island (Home)]
 
Radius:
   Now I understand...

Radius:
   Dario was possessed by the
   enmity of the Masamune, too.

Radius:
   Prepare yourselves!

Karsh:
   I guess there's no
   way outta this!

Riddel:
   I cannot face Dario
   in battle!
   
Glenn:
   Me, neither!
   I just found my brother!
   No, I cannot do this...
   
Radius:
   To abolish the darkness,
   we must defeat the Masamune!
   It is the only way
   to save Dario!
   
 [Garai]
   Face the enmity of my sword...
   
Radius:
   Do not give in to its enmity!
   Cast off the darkness!

Karsh:
   We can't just run from it!
   We have to settle this here!
 
 [Garai]
   Accept my sword and
   fall before its darkness...
   
Radius:
   Hmph!
   It appears the Masamune
   found a new master.

Karsh:
   What!?
   Lynx!!!?

Radius:
   Do not panic.
   Look around you.
   
Riddel:
   Birds...!
   The birds that fled
   are coming back!

Radius:
   I no longer sense the slightest
   bit of malice from the Masamune.
   There is no more fear of
   succumbing to its enmity.
   
Mune:
   Huaaah...
   You awake, Masa?
 
Masa:
   Yeah...
   But looking back...
   I think we've done
   something terrible.

Mune:
   Heh heh...
   No one will know if
   we don't tell.
   
Doreen:
   HEY!
   What were you
   two up to!?

Masa:
   Yikes!
   It's Doreen!
   
Mune:
   N-Nothing!
   We don't remember a thing!
   
Doreen:
   Hmmm, I see...
   Well, just to make sure
   you're not up to any mischief...
   I'm coming along.

Masa:
   Alright!
   How many centuries has it been
   since the 3 of us got together!?

Doreen:
   OK then, let's go!
   
   transformed
   into the Mastermune.
   
Dario:
   Where...am I...?
   
Dario:
   Riddel...
   Is that you, Riddel?
   What happened to me?

Riddel:
   Dario...
   Thank goodness...
   Your memory has returned.

Dario:
   Memory? Oh, yes...
   I had taken a hold of
   the Masamune when...
   Forgive me, Karsh...
   for what I have put you through.

Karsh:
   Ahh, forget about it!
 
Radius:
   Although your memory has
   returned, let us not forget
   the harsh reality
   which lies in wait.
   Come.
   
 [Woman]
   So...
   You will be leaving...
   I have been prepared
   for this day...

   Farewell...
   I wish you all the best...

Riddel:
   Everyone is hurt
   and separated...
   Inexperienced and incomplete...

Riddel:
   However, by living as such,
   we may change for the better
   into something bigger...
   Something more...gentle...
 
 [Viper Manor (Home)]
 
Dario:
   My goodness...
   What has happened
   during my absence!?

Dario:
   Where have the general
   and the others gone?

Dario:
   Riddel, you said that you
   all came from another world.
   Then where are Karsh, you,
   and the others in this world?
   
Radius:
   Unfortunately, no one from
   Viper Manor who went to the
   Dead Sea will return.

Dario:
   ...Why did the general
   and the others go to
   such a dangerous place?
   
Radius:
   In search of the Frozen Flame...
   They were swallowed up by
   a terminated time line...040
   and have perished along
   with the Dead Sea...

Dario:
   Sigh...
   How ironic that it is I
   who have survived...

Riddel:
   But Dario...
   You still have me.

Dario:
   Riddel...

Riddel:
   We may be from different
   worlds, but you are you,
   and I am I.
   
Karsh:
   Yo! That's right!
   I'm alive and kickin', too!
   There ain't no one
   who can take my life!
   Gah-haha-ha!
   
Karsh:
   Zoah and Marcy are
   here, too... We can also call
   the old dragon stable keeper!

Dario:
   Thank you, everyone...

Dario:
   I guess you are right.
   I am alive.
   And I will do whatever
   I must do.
   
Dario:
   I do not know how many
   years it will take, but
   I will rebuild Viper Manor.
   It is my duty.

Radius:
   My, my, my...
   Perhaps it's about time
   I came out of retirement...
   Time for one last hurrah!
   Hoh-hoh-hoh!

Karsh:
   OH YEAH!
   Bring it on!
   Even though we may be from
   different worlds, the 4
   Devas are back in business!

Glenn:
   Brother!
   I've matured into
   quite a swordsman
   in the past 4 years!

Karsh:
   But...maybe minus 1.
   I don't think you're
   fit for battle, yet.
   
Dario:
   Forgive me...
   4 years of isolation
   have taken their toll.

Riddel:
   Are you alright?
   
Dario:
   Riddel...
   I want you to take this.

   SnakeFangs!

Riddel:
   Please rest up and just
   concentrate on rebuilding
   Viper Manor.
   
Dario:
   Thank you.
   I shall do so.

Riddel:
   Of course, I will
   help you, too.
   Plus, I have
   an idea...
   Ha-hah-ha!
   
Norris:
   So this explains the noise
   that was coming from above...

Norris:
   The other soldiers
   have withdrawn
   from their posts.
   
Dario:
   Hmmm...
   Well, I did say I would
   open the doors to all the
   children who lost their parents
   during this past struggle...
   However, this remodeling job
   is a little too...

Riddel:
   We have to bear
   in mind that children
   will be living here.
   Why not officially make
   this place into an orphanage?

Riddel:
   Well, daddy?
   
Viper:
   Errr...
   Hmmm...
   
[Boy]
   I had them finish the
   sand box first.
   
   Hello, Headmaster!
   
 [Girl]
   Some swings would be nice, too.
   
   Please, Headmaster!?

 [Girl]
   This is my house!
   Huge, isn't it?
   
   I hope we all can
   live together soon!
   Don't you agree, Headmaster?

 [Girl]
   We can play a serious game
   of hide-and-seek with a
   yard this big!
 
   C'mon, let's play,
   Headmaster!

Viper:
   Who are you calling
   Headmaster!?

   just beyond here.
   
Water Dragon:
   The time has come...
   My powers I shall grant
   to the ones who seek to break
   the eternal chains of fate.

Water Dragon:
   What is it thou seeketh?
   ~~~I seek nothing
   ~~~The Dragon God's blessing
   
Water Dragon:
   Dost thou need the powers of
   the Sleeping Dragons to cross
   the Dead Sea?
   Dost thou seeketh to break the
   chains of fate?
   A son of man to challenge
   the Goddess of Fate?
   Fascinating...
   Then confront my trials.

Water Dragon:
   ...Well done, son of man.
   Thy strength is worthy of
   my powers.
   Take with thee my prayers...
   
Water Dragon:
   ...Too weak.
   Is thy strength so meager?
   Disappoint me not.

Water Dragon:
   Where hast thine vigor gone?
   If thou canst not defeat me,
   thou shall be no match for
   the Goddess of Fate.
   Wilt thou stop thy march here,
   or live forever, bound by fate?
   ~~~Give up for now
   ~~~Take the trial once more
   
Water Dragon:
   So thou seeketh to face my
   trials again.
   Thine spirit is commendable...
   Then I shall restore your
   lost strength.

Water Dragon:
   Now, come!
   Show thy strength in front
   of mine eyes, son of man!
   
Water Dragon:
   The three mutual powers that
   obliterated the Dead Sea,
   they are none other than the god
   who decides the world's fate,
   the god that rules mankind,
   '"FATE."'
   For mankind to be mankind...
   For the planet to be a planet...
   Thou who is bound by fate.
   ...Go now, to the Sea of Eden.
 
   BlueRelic.
   
Water Dragon:
   I too shall watch over thy Fate,
   how thou struggle to live,
   and how thou face death...

Water Dragon:
   Cross the worlds and seek the
   remaining Dragon Gods.
   When all of our powers are
   gathered, the Sea of Eden
   shall open its gates.

   How did you get that flute...?
   It beeba handed down in Beeba family...
   That beeba mine, too.........!!!

BubbaBeeba:
   BEEBA-BAH-BAH-BAH!!!
   Why you beeba-live?
   What happened to Wingapede!?

BubbaBeeba:
   It brings shame to Beeba family
   if we always beeba defeated.
   Time for bee-venge!

 [Beeba]
   Beeba-Beeba!
   
BubbaBeeba:
   I beeba-ry sorry!
   Here! I give you this!
   Please forgive beeba!
   This beeba Ancient Fruit
   found in Ancient Ground.
   You will beeba-ble to tame
   Wingapede with this.
   
BubbaBeeba:
   All you have to do now is
   blow the Beeba Flute.
   That beeba the truth.
   If you blow the flute further
   down the branch where my friend
   beeba standing, you will beeba-ble
   to ride Wingapede to Ancient Ground.
   
BubbaBeeba:
   I beeba strong!
   You beeba no match for me!
   
BubbaBeeba:
   Why do you have Ancient Fruit?
   Oh well...
   That beeba no business of mine.

BubbaBeeba:
   I wish you the beebesta luck.

BubbaBeeba:
   You beeba persistent!
   I'll make you regret
   sticking around here!
   
BubbaBeeba:
   What is it?
   I have plenty of ancient fruit.
   Don't beeba-fraid to ask.
   
BubbaBeeba:
   You and me beeba comrades.
   If there's anything you want to
   know, don't beeba-fraid to ask.
   ~~~No, that's OK
   ~~~What's Ancient Ground?
   ~~~What's the Ancient Fruit?
   ~~~What's a Wingapede?
   
BubbaBeeba:
   The legendary '"Ancient Ground"'
   of us Beebas. You know it as
   '"Gaea's Navel."'
   It beeba a remote island surrounded
   by cliffs, in the sea of El Nido.
   It beeba a mystical place where
   a '"Primeval Forest"' may still exist.
   
BubbaBeeba:
   That beeba what elder said long ago.
   I've never beenba to Ancient Ground.
   I like it here.
  
BubbaBeeba:
   With the flute alone, even
   we Beebas will get attacked.
   You need '"Ancient Fruit."'
   We Beebas grow this fruit.
   It beeba big, but so is Wingapede.

BubbaBeeba:
   You can tame Wingapede with
   just one bite of the fruit.
   So you just need 1 for round trip.
   
BubbaBeeba:
   It beeba a big bug.
   I think you fought it before.
   It likes to fly in this forest.
   Wingapede fly from Ancient
   Ground to this forest.
   Ride Wingapede and you will beeba
   able to go to Ancient Ground.

BubbaBeeba:
   You need both Beeba Flute
   and Ancient Fruit to call
   Wingapede safely.
   My friend beeba on branch
   further down. Blow flute there
   and Wingapede will come flying.
   Then, you can ride Wingapede.
   
BubbaBeeba:
   Let me know when you run out.
   I have lots of fruit.
   Don't beeba-fraid to ask.
   
BubbaBeeba:
   You want to go to
   '"Ancient Ground?"'
   Then call Wingapede here.
   You beeba use flute and
   Ancient Fruit.
   Use flute to call Wingapede
   and feed it the fruit!

BubbaBeeba:
   Wait, you don't have fruit.
   You beeba not blow flute!
   Wingapede will attack even me!

   We'll be able to make

 [Earth Dragon Isle (Home)]

Captain:
   We've searched every square inch
   of this surface but found nothing...
   There has to be something...!
   The only possible entrance I can
   think of is this sand boil hole,
   but once you go in, you get shot
   right back out.
   The only place left is the quicksand...

Captain:
   I've lost quite a number of
   men to quicksand in my past
   explorations...
   I still can't get over the fear...
   You're pretty much a goner
   once you set foot in that stuff...
 
 [Captain]
   Hey, guys!
   That's quicksand over there!
   Step in there and you'll never
   see the light of day again!
   
   What are they, crazy!?
   I warned them, too!
   Dammit... Damn amateurs...!
   
Captain:
   Are you guys alright!?
   I thought you were
   goners for sure!
   
Captain:
   So the quicksand is the entrance,
   and the sand boil is the exit...
   Now why couldn't I figure that out?
   So there was something blocking
   a pathway, you say?
   OK, let us take care of it.
   It may take some time, though.
   
Captain:
   Let's see, now... I need to
   assign some men to investigate and
   prepare explosives to move that rock...
   Would you mind coming back in
   a little while? We have some
   preparations to do.
   But thanks a lot for your help.
   
Captain:
   I still can't believe the
   quicksand was the entrance...
   Well, I guess that shows it's
   often difficult to see what's
   right in front of your eyes...
 
Captain:
   Oh, it's you.
   Sorry, we need more time.
   Come back in a little while.
 
   No use staying here.
 
Member:
   What is this thing?
   We can't get through
   with this in the way.

Member:
   Can't we just
   push this thing
   out of the way?

Member:
   The thing won't budge.
   I don't think the 3
   of us can move it, either.

Member:
   We should probably head
   back up for now. There's
   no use staying here.
   
Captain:
   Our investigation is
   finally under way.
   Thanks to you, of course.
   And we were also able to move
   that thing you were worried about.
   All it took was some explosives
   to clear the path.
   
Captain:
   ...This is totally off the subject,
   but have you heard of a raw
   material called '"rainbow?"'
   It's a fossil of a rainbow shell,
   which used to exist long, long ago.
   It's a very rare item these days.
   I can't thank you enough for getting
   our investigation started.
   Here, take this rainbow as a
   token of my appreciation.
   
Captain:
   I've heard that by combining rainbows
   with certain materials, you can forge
   high quality weapons and armor...
   But it takes a skilled hand and
   special tools to accomplish.
   That just goes to show how difficult
   it is to handle rainbows.

   Rainbow.
 
 [Explorer]
   You see that monster over there,
   sitting as still as a rock?
   It's called a '"Rockroach."'
   It won't attack you as long
   as you don't approach it.
   It's pretty much harmless.
   
   So, how are my explosives
   working out?
   Having a blast? Heh heh...!

   You see that monster over there,
   sitting as still as a rock?
   It's called a '"Rockroach."'
   It won't attack you as long
   as you don't approach it.
   It's pretty much harmless.

   But I tell ya, that thing
   must weigh a ton.
   Our explosives have just barely
   enough power to blow it away.
   By the way, I was the one who
   blasted that one, and it was
   actually my special explosives
   that did the trick!

   Hey, why don't I give you
   some of my explosives?
   They really pack a punch!
   I'm sure they'll come in handy.
   ~~~Sure, I'll take some
   ~~~No, too dangerous to handle

   Oh, there's one thing
   I have to warn you about.
   You can only blast the ones
   that are just sitting there.
   Not any that are moving about or
   coming towards you to attack.
   But hey, I guarantee you'll
   have a blast with these, heh heh!
   Oh, and stay clear of the
   shockwaves from the blast.

   Here you go.
   Put them to good use.

   Member received
   Explosive!

   Oh... Oh well...
   But come back anytime if
   you really need them.
   I have plenty, you know!

Member:
   It's not attacking...
   Maybe we can use
   the explosives
   on this thing?
 
   Explosive.

Member:
   Looks like the same
   one that was blocking
   the path...
   Even if you touch it,
   it won't attack.
 
   ~~~Push it
   ~~~Leave it alone

Member:
   Looks like it's
   a dead end.

Member:
   Could this just be a natural
   cavern of some sort?
   It doesn't seem like a ruin.

   There's no point

   Welcome, humans.
   I am the Sky Dragon of the

Sky Dragon:
   First, gain the protection
   of the Five Dragons of the

   Water Dragon, Earth Dragon,
   Fire Dragon, Black Dragon,
   and Green Dragon.
   Return to me, only once thou
   hath gained all of them!

   Well done. Thou hath gained the
   protection of the Five Dragons.

   The Dead Sea has disintegrated,

   As promised, I will lend you the
   Dragon Tear.
   I shall accompany you

Steena:
   May the 6 Dragon Gods
   bestow protection upon we
   children of the planet...

   Now, take the Dragon Tear
   with you...to the '"Room of

Steena:
   ...Chief Direa,
   it is a pleasure
   to see you again.
   
Direa:
   Why, if it isn't Steena.
   ...I see, you have already
   succeeded me as chief in
   the alternate world...
   Things are indeed proceeding
   differently in the other world.
   I have no idea what that implies,
   though.

Direa:
   The only thing certain,
   is that the fate of both
   worlds depends on you all...
   The fate of men and Dragons...
   It will be a trying battle.
   Proceed with care,
   young shaman...
   
Direa:
   The end of your battle
   will welcome a huge change
   to this planet.
   
Steena:
   It is a strange feeling to
   be facing myself.
   An alternate world...
   Whether you will discover the
   future of mankind at the end
   of your journey is uncertain,
   but I will pray for your success.
   
Steena:
   There is no one here
   who can foresee the future of
   the battle...
   The battle between
   Dragons, humans, and fate...
   Will humans change the world, or
   is the world fated to change...
   
Steena:
   ...All creation is guided by fate.
   
Direa:
   Hmm...this amulet seems
   to have extraordinary power
   within it.
   Be careful young one, such
   powers can bring about
   mysterious phenomenon, opening
   doors to unknown worlds.

Direa:
   Hold on to that
   Dragon Tear piece.
   Though it may be shattered,
   all is not lost, as long
   as its sparkle does not fade...

 [Dragonian Record]
   All life on this planet
   was born in the sea.
   
   The life-forms softly
   slumbered within the
   womb of our mother sea...

   Until eventually they
   developed free will and
   were able to swim about
   the ocean freely.
   
   Then there came those that,
   not satisfied with life in the
   water, looked up from the ocean
   floor towards the blue skies and
   dreamt of the feel of the land.
   
   Aeons passed before their
   preposterous dream became
   a reality, and they rose up
   from the seas onto the earth.

   The land became full of
   all kinds of creatures.
   
   Among these, the dragon lizards
   and the more evolved Reptites
   thought they would reign over
   the earth forever.

   And for a long while it
   seemed that they would...

   However, the unforeseen
   coming of the mighty one from
   the heavens suddenly smashed
   their kingdom to pieces.

   That one was known as '"Lavos!"'
   The great crimson flame......
   
   Wielding absolute power,
   Lavos buried the dinosaurs -
   the kings of the land -
   in the space of a night.

   However, the timid '"apes"'
   who had lived hidden in
   the forests...
   
   ...came into contact with
   the crimsom flame
   that fell from the sky,
   and evolved into '"humans."'

   Or perhaps it was
   not '"evolution,"'
   but '"transformation."'
   
   In this way, humans
   increased in number
   and filled the earth...

   The fearsome '"progeny of Lavos"'
   who, like their progenitor,
   began to devour our mother planet.

Member:
   Serge!!!
   
Steena:
   Serge....
   You have regained your identity
   without being led astray.
   Your eyes, which foresaw
   the truth, shall help you
   to regain your trust among
   your comrades...
   There is nothing we can do
   about the Dragon Tear...
   Its shattering result does
   not come as a surprise.
   However, you also carry
   the fate of the Dragon Tear
   from another world.
   The broken pieces of
   love and hate: although
   contradictory, they are two
   sides of the same coin...
   A mysterious force may
   come to light when the
   two pieces are united...
   Perhaps this force will be
   the legendary Chrono Cross...
   The only problem is, the shrine,
   which is said to give life to the
   Chrono Cross, is nothing but a
   cavern inside Divine Dragon Falls.
   Serge....
   You may hold the key to
   bringing forth its powers.

   Yes, I'm Leena, too,

   Don't fret over it,

   I'm sure Serge will
   explain it to you one day.

   This is beyond me, but

   By the way, Serge.
   Leena tells me that

    And the first time
    you met me, you
    called me a liar!

   the counter-time effect...
   
 [Ghost]
   Yeah, but based on previous
   experiments, I'm sure it'll
   work out just fine.
   During their simulation,
   FATE guaranteed that they
   would be able to use the
   Flame as an up-link to
   extract the anti-annihilation
   energy associated with it.
   Don't worry, it'll be a success.

   Originally, El Nido was
   nothing but ocean.
   The El Nido Archipelago
   is purely artificial,
   created by FATE.
   It was a remodeling plan that
   took place 10,000 years ago.
   A plan to include islands, blessed
   with nature, in the sea of El Nido.
   The main island of El Nido,
   Earth Dragon Isle, Water Dragon Isle,
   Black Dragon Isle...
   The development of Elements,
   using the energy of the
   natural world...
   The distribution of memory
   terminal devices called the
   Records of Fate that could
   survey and guide
   people's lives...
   The research center staff, who
   had their memories of the future
   erased, left the center, and began
   a life outside amidst nature.
   This is how FATE's paradise
   came into existence.

   And for over 10,000 years,
   FATE has been watching over and
   guiding the descendants of the
   staff who left this research center.
   Everything was in pefect harmony.
   That is, until 14 years ago,
   when a boy came into contact with 
   the Flame on the night of the storm.

   Memory scanning and
   rewriting is not that
   difficult a thing.
   As a matter of fact, it
   is possible to simulate
   the thoughts and feelings
   of each individual.
   These are all just electric
   signals that flow around
   the circuitry of the brain,
   after all.
   The vessels of flesh can
   be reproduced through
   cloning...
   And the '"soul"'
   stored within these
   fleshly vessels can
   be simulated as well...
   Thus, one could even go so
   far as to say that death
   itself no longer exists.
   Of course the expiration
   of an individual being,
   as a variation within the
   species, still occurs.
   Overall, we can reverse the
   old maxim and say that where
   there is no death there will
   be life...

   We control human emotions
   by using neurotransmitters.
   That means, by manipulating
   the nerve transmitters inside
   their brains, it's possible to
   control the feelings and even
   the personalities of humans.
   FATE uses the Records of Fate
   to connect directly to the
   brains of the humans with
   whom they come into contact.
   FATE not only imprints what
   actions the humans should
   take into their brains, but
   also rewrites their
   personalities and feelings.

   The life-forms on this planet
   developed from single-celled
   microorganisms to protozoans...
   Then from fish to amphibians...
   from reptiles to mammals...
   and eventually to humans.
   Beginning with a cerebral
   neocortex, which only
   exists in higher mammals...
   The anthropod brain enlarged
   at an accelerating pace until it
   became the human brain we know.
   Could the reason for the
   abnormal development of the
   human brain be the biological
   contamination caused by Lavos?
   That would mean that humans are
   really a heterogeneous life-form,
   or '"foreign matter,"' as far as
   the planet is concerned.
   Humans are a sudden mutation
   caused by the contact with
   Lavos -- an alien life-form that
   fell to this planet from space.
   That is why humans are,
   biologically speaking,
   unbalanced and half-finished.
   Internally inconsistent and
   disconnected, the human
   existence is plagued by
   contradictions.
   An incomplete species,
   torn between love and hatred,
   whose very being is self-
   contradictory.
   From the planet's viewpoint,
   humans are just destroyers
   and a cursed, yet perhaps
   pathetic, blight on the world.

   ~
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   An extraterrestrial life-form
   that is thought to have
   fallen from the heavens
   65 million years ago.
   On the time line that existed
   before history was changed,
   Lavos was assumed to have
   slept deep below the planet's
   surface...
   Sleeping and consuming the
   planet's energy up until the
   day of destruction known as
   the '"Apocalypse."'
   There are those who believe
   that, 12 thousand years ago,
   the legendary ancient magical
   civilization known as Zeal
   came into contact with Lavos.
   That fateful encounter is
   said to have resulted in
   Zeal disappearing from the
   surface of the planet within
   the space of a single night.
   However, the very existence
   of the ancient civilization
   of Zeal has never been proven,
   so up till this day this
   theory cannot be confirmed.
   On some time lines, Lavos
   appeared on the surface of
   the planet in the year 1999
   and brought the world to
   ruins.
   However, a group of young
   time travelers saw where
   their planet's history was
   heading and, through their
   actions, rewrote time.
   This very research facility
   exists on that new time line...
   In a world where, thanks to
   the defeat of Lavos by the
   young adventurers, the
   Apocalypse never happened...
   On a temporal vector where
   human civilization continued
   to evolve unhampered.
   All the data on Lavos that was
   obtained from tracing different
   parallel world possibilities
   has proven to be volatile, with
   fluctuating discrepencies.
   Perhaps, at this point in time,
   it is nearly impossible to
   obtain any true information
   about Lavos.

   ~~ -- HUMANS & REPTITES -- ~~

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   65 million years ago, the
   Reptites who evolved from
   reptiles had developed their
   own unique civilization...
   This was long before the
   ancestors of humans, who
   evolved from primates, had
   developed their civilization.
   Excavations carried out on the
   central continent of Zenan have
   revealed that the Reptites
   already had advanced architectural
   skills in the prehistoric era.
   But the fall of Lavos to the
   planet, and the resulting
   Ice Age this brought about,
   rang the death knell for the
   Reptites and their civilization.
   After that the Reptites
   slowly disappeared from
   the stage of history.
   However, in the distant past
   humans could have been defeated
   in the contest of evolution,
   and the Reptites could have
   continued to develop...
   It is not unthinkable that
   such a time line could exist
   in other dimensions.
   Everything is purely a
   problem of possibilities,
   and the world is only
   stabilized by the viewpoint
   of the one who observes it.

   Everyone gather around.
   
   Let's see...
   In the 11th Century, a scientist
   by the name of Lucca indicated the
   possibility of time travel through
   the use of a '"Time Egg,"' which
   utilizes miniature black holes.
   Whether this could actually be
   possible or not is still the
   subject of intense debate and
   no conclusions have been made.

   According to her theory, by
   rotating a single point of
   supergravity, space-time
   continua can be drawn in...
   thus making it possible to
   transform that singular point
   which pulls in everything else,
   into a ring formation.
   Using this ring as a Gate
   between dimensions, it should
   be possible to travel back and
   forth between various space-time.
   
 [Ghost]
   I've heard that the Time Egg
   already existed during the
   legendary, ancient dynasty.
   
 [Ghost]
   We shouldn't have to rely
   on theories from an ancient
   civilization that may not
   have even existed.
   We can do this.
   
 [Ghost]
   But it's been said that time was
   altered using the Time Egg...
   
 [Ghost]
   That's just a legend.
   There isn't even any
   evidence to prove that this
   ancient dynasty ever existed.

 [Ghost]
   The experiment should
   be starting soon.
   After we discovered an unusual
   gravitational field in this
   barren sea of El Nido we built
   several artificial islands and
   established Chronopolis.
   This was all done to facilitate
   our top secret research.
   But now, our research is
   about to come to its end.
   Once the final adjustments
   are made, the experiment will
   commence.
   It's just a matter of time...
   so everyone should keep up
   their good work!

 [Ghost]
   The chief hasn't returned yet.

   He hasn't...?
   Then, we'll have to hold
   off until he gets back.
   
   To think that time is not
   absolute, but elastic...
   Relative and subjective...
   That there can be individual
   differences caused by changes
   in time...
   Perhaps the same people and
   life-forms can even exist in
   several different space-times.
   An independent time that flows
   with a will of its own...?
   Hah... What nonsense...
   
 [Ghost]
   We're conducting a simulation
   of phase metastasis.

   The lost, ancient magic
   civilization of Zeal...
   If it really did exist,
   someone may have even

   However, at the peak of his

   FATE is a large-scale
   prototype, completed
   in the year 2300.
   It integrated the old
   Mother Brain computer
   circuitry into a more
   powerful super-computer.
 
 [Ghost]
   This FATE contains a massive
   amount of historical data
   dating up to the year 2400.
 
 [Ghost]
   This is the observation room.
   This is where we observe
   the 2 parallel worlds.
 
 [Ghost]
   The main computer
   of Chronopolis
   is called '"FATE."'

   Card Key!
 
 [Party]
   The Record of Fate is exposed!?

 [Computer]
   Two worlds that are so close,
   and yet so far in nature, exist
   in different dimensions.
   Under the surveillance of the
   main computer of Chronopolis...
   '"FATE."'
   In other words, FATE, has
   always been observing the 2
   parallel worlds, and guiding them.

   FATE has been manipulating the
   world of El Nido, in order to
   avoid any major change to the
   history it knows.
   If an event on El Nido
   influences the main continent,
   the year 2400, in which FATE
   exists, would change.
   This paradox could potentially
   lead to great disaster...

   The Records of Fate - FATE's Terminals -
   collect data from around the world,
   and input guidance directly into the
   minds of its users.
   In this discreet way, FATE is able
   to control the lives of people
   without them knowing.
   Guided by fate, the people of
   El Nido lead a harmonious life.
   In a sense, they are nothing
   more than puppets of FATE.

   in Arni 01 to give up going to
   the main continent as a poet.
   An instruction to the man in
   Arni 02 to give up becoming

   A plan to avoid any point of
   contact with the main continent,
   so as not to affect history.
   
   However...
   Ever since the formation of
   the Dead Sea 10 years ago...
   FATE has been unable to intervene
   directly with World 01.
   The best FATE could do was cross
   the dimension and receive data
   through the Records of Fate.
   And with much difficulty, FATE
   succeeded in binding Miguel
   to the Dead Sea as a watchman...

Member:
   What!?
   
Lynx:
   14 years ago, on the night
   of a terrible storm,
   the cogs began to turn.
   That night, Wazuki and Miguel
   set out to sea carrying a
   sick, young child in their
   boat.
   That child was you, Serge,
   after you had been attacked
   by that panther demon.
   Your poisoned wounds were
   beyond the healing abilities
   of the doctors in Termina or
   even Guldove.
   So they set sail to Marbule
   in order to see the sage
   there...not knowing how bad
   the storm would become.
   Being skilled sailors,
   the two men were able to
   survive the storm.
   But they were blown off
   course and came ashore on
   this island, where they
   decided to seek shelter.
   At the time, this research
   center was off-line due to
   the severity of the storm.
   It only took 10 minutes for
   the system to power back up,
   but by then, the Flame had
   found you...

Lynx:
   Contact with the Flame
   healed your young body.
   But that was not all...
   Once the security card
   system was rebooted, it
   would only grant access
   to you...the '"arbiter."'
   You can't imagine the
   trouble this caused the
   FATE computer system in
   achieving its objective.
   Inside of FATE, there was a
   stand-alone circuit that had
   been kept hidden since the
   old Mother Brain generation.
   That circuit was designed to
   start a malfunction, or more
   precisely, a '"rebellion."'
   
Lynx:
   Who would have thought that
   such a small bug, a '"traitor,"'
   could exist inside of FATE?
   That hidden circuit was based
   on the initial Ashtear model
   circuit board, with extra logic
   added by another scientist.
   FATE itself did not realize
   that this circuit was present
   within the core of its system.
   Or, more correctly...
   ...the circuit was programmed
   so that the moment FATE did
   detect it, it would erase all
   record of its detection.

Lynx:
   Dr. Lucca Ashtear...
   Unbelievably intelligent,
   and incredibly enthusiastic.
   You might even go so far as
   to call her a mad scientist.
   Of course I don't believe
   it was Lucca alone that
   devised this plan.
   I'm sure the first curator
   of this research center,
   a man named Belthasar,
   had a hand in it, too.
   
Lynx:
   FATE!
   Bring out the traitor,
   Prometheus...

   At the same time, another
   city from a different
   dimension's future, was
   also thrown back in time.
   Dinopolis... The future city
   of the Reptites -- Azala's
   descendants, who had evolved
   more closely with the planet.
   Just as Lavos, in an attempt
   to save itself, summoned
   Chronopolis from the distant
   future...
   Perhaps our planet beckoned
   Dinopolis into the past...
   maybe as a measure against
   Chronopolis and humanity.

Kid:
   It wasn't the Dragon Gods
   who sealed up the Frozen
   Flame!
   It was FATE, which used the
   Flame's power to divide and
   seal the Dragons in slumber!
   And now that FATE has been
   defeated, the Dragons will
   join together again to
   start their revenge!
   
Harle:
   I feared it would
   come to zis...
   I didn't want to
   have to fight wit'
   you if it could
   have been avoided!

   Adieu, Serge!
   Adieu!

   Yes.
   We cannot just twiddle
   our thumbs and do nothing.
   
Viper:
   The only problem is...
   
Fargo:
   So, we have ta find
   a way up there, right?
   It's not like the great
   S.S. Invincible can make
   it up there, either...
   
Riddel:
   There has to be a way.

Glenn:
   Yes, the world has
   infinite possibilities.
   There has to be something
   that will help us reach
   that tower.

   Hmmm... At least our

   I do not know how,

Glenn:
   Well, at least she can
   rest quietly there.
   Plus, Radius will
   watch over her.
   
Riddel:
   Her spirit seems to be
   possessed by the past.
   A powerful item is
   necessary in order
   to dispel it.

   Tear or the Masamune...?

Luccia:
   It's for you...
   from Lucca...

Kid:
   !!!
   You knew Lucca!?

Luccia:
   Here...
   
 [Lucca's Letter]
   My dear Kid,
   How are you doing?
   I wonder how old you are
   as you read this letter?

   Perhaps you've matured into
   a beautiful woman, raising a
   happy family, by now?

   I was hoping to talk to you in
   person when you were old enough,
   but just in case something happens,
   I'm writing my feelings down on
   paper and leaving it with Luccia.

   Perhaps you already know...
   or perhaps you yourself are
   also now caught up in some
   historic crisis as a result
   of all this.
   But, anyway...
   
   A long time ago, we -- my friends
   and I, that is -- changed the future
   in order to save our planet from
   being devoured by Lavos, a monster
   from some unknown planet.
   
   We still feel proud of the role
   we played in saving our world,
   and in how we were so freely
   able to change the flow of time.

   But sometimes I think of the darker
   side of what we did...
   What has become of the future that
   was '"once"' supposed to have existed?
   Where did the '"time"' that now is no
   longer allowed to exist '"go?"'
   
   It is true that, thanks to our
   altering the flow of history,
   we were able to save so many
   lives and prevent so much sadness
   and suffering...
   But when you think of it, we also
   caused the deaths of so many that
   were meant to have come into
   existence in the time line we
   destroyed, and also caused new
   sadness and suffering further along
   in the new future we created...
   
   That is why I worry that someone
   might seek revenge on us for
   what we did.
   I have had a constant dread in my
   heart that someone in our new
   future will travel back in time,
   just like we did, and try and kill
   or capture my friends and me.
 
   So, even if something dreadful
   does befall me, Kid, know
   that what was meant to happen
   will happen, and that I was
   always prepared for the worst.

   Oh, but don't you dare think the
   Great Lucca is going to go down
   without a fight!
   (I've got a reputation to uphold!)

   Whatever lies waiting for us
   around the next corner better
   watch out, 'cause it's gonna
   find a pretty mean counter-
   attack coming its way!

   Kid...
   When I think of you,
   I remember someone I once
   met a long, long time ago
   in the distant past...

   Heh! But she was the complete
   opposite of the you in this
   time line...
   So quiet and gentle...
   
   Someday I'll also tell you
   about her...
   When you are ready to know
   of your real name and heritage.

   I'm not the slightest bit
   worried about you, Kid!
   I know that, no matter what
   happens, '"he"' will always be
   there looking out for you!

   Or perhaps he has already
   found you and is there by
   your side as you read this?
   If so, hello, Janus!
   Please take good care of
   my '"little sister"' for me!
   
   There is so much more I want to
   to tell you, but I must leave it
   for another time.
   Don't worry! Everything is okay!
   We will overcome whatever woes
   may occur! That's for certain!

   Later, when you're all grown
   up, I'll come visit you and we'll
   talk over tea.
   I look forward to that day!

   Well, anyway Kid,
   until we meet again...

   Forever and ever your friend,
   (No matter which time line it is!)
   ~~~~~~~~yours sincerely,
   ~~~~~~~~Lucca Ashtear

   P.S.
   Cut out the tomboy act!
   Believe me! You'll become a
   beautiful young lady one day, or

   my own, I couldn't even break
   the top 100 chart.
   Inc17001What's even worse was
   that nobody accepted my looks,
   or the meaning behind my songs.
   I was way depressed...
   I didn't think I had the talent,
   so I stopped believing in myself.
   I was this close to quitting...

Nikki:
   But one day, a woman stopped
   by my trailer and said...
   '"Your songs sing of
    magical dreams.
    They're beautiful..."'
   Those words made me
   so happy...
   That's when I decided that
   if I were ever to have my
   own band, I would name it
   '"Magical Dreamers!!!"'
   
Kid:
   Huh...
   I think I might have
   an idea who that
   woman might be...
   
Nikki:
   ......!
   You know her!?
   Inc17002Please, tell me
   who she is!
   I've been wanting to
   thank her all these years!

Kid:
   ......
   One of these days, I'll tell ya.
   ...When everythin's over.
   
Nikki:
   Looks like you have
   your reasons...
   OK, then,
   that's a promise.

Kid:
   Yeah, sure...
   But when that time comes,
   let me hear some of
   yer old songs.

   I wanna go to that

   Many rumours have surfaced

   Perhaps you should
   head down there?

   I've discovered a mysterious

   a nasty monster guarding it.
   
   No matter how many times
   I hack away at it, it doesn't
   seem to have any effect.
   I've tried some Elements, too.
   There are some that

Member:
   There must be someone
   who knows how to

Member:
   Rumor has it
   that a star fell into
   this ocean, along with
   a star child.
   Perhaps that child
   is alive somewhere?
   
Member:
   Then we have to find

Member:
   What was that...?
   Are you human?

 [Prisoner]
   When I was still human,
   I was locked up here, and
   I have been here ever since...

   This tower is a fortress belonging
   to the ancient Reptites...
   A symbol of revenge, brought
   against mankind by the Dragons...

   With the defeat of FATE,
   the seal has been broken
   and this tower has surfaced...

   In the eyes of the Dragons,
   we humans are the foes...
   
   A brain that has developed abnormally
   to 3 times the original size in the
   span of 3 million years...

   We humans have evolved at an
   enormous rate because of our
   contact with Lavos's flame...

   In a sense, mankind is Lavos's offspring...

   We humans are extraneous to this planet...

   Now...
   How will you fight,

   Where are we?
   Is this...
   Viper Manor?

Prophet:
   This is a space that
   does not exist.
   But don't mind that...
   More importantly,
   I have something I
   must explain to you!

Member:
   .........
   Who are you?

Prophet:
   Oh, my name is
   Belthasar...
   
Belthasar:
   In the ancient, magical
   Kingom of Zeal, I was known
   as a sage of reason...
   
Belthasar:
   Well, that was up until the
   Queen of Zeal attempted to
   harness the power of Lavos...
   Let's just say, things got out
   of control and Lavos created a
   dimensional vortex that threw
   me far into the future!

Belthasar:
   There, I seized the opportunity
   to study the science of the
   future...
   I was then able to apply to that
   the knowledge I brought from my
   own era, including magic, which
   was long lost in the future.
   Anyway, this led me to make
   huge progress in the research
   of time.

Belthasar:
   Well, that research led to
   the creation of Chronopolis
   and to the Time Crash...
   You might think I really
   blew it, but perhaps it
   was really my finest hour!
   Ho-ho-hoh...
   
Belthasar:
   Anyway... I created a compact
   time machine that I dubbed
   the '"Neo Epoch."'
   I used it to time warp to this
   age to learn of Chronopolis and
   FATE's plans, and to see how
   things were turning out.

Belthasar:
   Terra Tower is really a
   city of the Reptites, from
   another dimension's future...

Belthasar:
   It was originally
   '"Dinopolis"'...
   The castle of Azala's
   descendants, who achieved
   an evolution much more
   intimate with our planet.

Belthasar:
   Dinopolis was drawn into
   this dimension's past about
   ten thousand years ago...

Belthasar:
   This was done so that it
   would serve as a counter-
   balance against Chronopolis,
   which Lavos pulled here.
   
Belthasar:
   Needless to say,
   a fierce battle ensued...

Belthasar:
   In the end, Chronopolis emerged
   as the victor, and the Reptite's
   fortress was sealed away by FATE...

Belthasar:
   But more important now
   is the role the Dragons
   play in all of this...
   Originally the whole
   Archipelago of El Nido
   was known as the
   Sea of Eden.
   This was because it was
   where the Dragon Gods
   resided.
   
Belthasar:
   But then FATE sealed away
   the Dragon Gods' powers, in
   effect becoming a god itself.
   Thus the islands where the
   new godhead, FATE, existed
   came to be called the
   Sea of Eden instead.

Belthasar:
   Perhaps you didn't realize it,
   but you were used by the
   Dragon Gods to eliminate FATE!
   
Belthasar:
   It was not true that the
   Dragon Gods sealed away
   the Frozen Flame...
   Rather, it's quite the opposite...
   It was FATE that used the power
   of the Flame to seal up the
   Dragon Gods.
   In reality, the Dragon Gods are
   in opposition to man, while
   FATE itself was actually the
   protector of humanity!
   
Belthasar:
   The Dragon Gods were originally
   a singular plasma life-form...
   ...A living accumulation of the
   planet's energy!
   Originally it was a biological
   machine used to control the
   powers of nature in the future
   society of the Reptites.
   In order to control the natural
   energy itself, FATE divided the
   one Dragon God entity up into
   6 weaker plasma life-forms...
   Then scattered them across
   the land and sealed them away.
   Their dragon-like appearances
   are just pseudo-guises...
   ...Temporary forms they take
   so that they can appear in
   this dimension.

Belthasar:
   But all that changed when
   FATE was vanquished and its
   powerhold was eliminated!
   At that moment, the seven
   Dragons who had been
   rendered almost powerless
   and forgotten...
   traveled across the
   dimensions to reunite
   into a single entity!

Member:
   Seven Dragons?
   I thought there
   were only six!?

Belthasar:
   There were six Dragons
   you knew of and one more
   hidden Dragon you didn't...
   Like the second moon
   that once was lost,
   but later was found...
   Although the same planet,
   my world didn't have two
   moons!
   Look up at the night sky
   now and you will see seven
   celestial bodies...
   Five stars and two moons...
   Five brother stars that
   correspond to the five
   colored Dragons, ruling like
   gods over the night skies...
   One moon that corresponds
   to the white Sky Dragon...
   And another darker, daughter
   moon to counterbalance them.
 
Belthasar:
   The Fire Dragon,
   the Water Dragon,
   the Green Dragon,
   the Earth Dragon,
   the Black Dragon,
   the Sky Dragon,
   and one more...
   The final Dragon...
   The dark moon Dragon...
   The one who was to work to
   free the other Dragons from
   their bondage by the FATE
   computer...
   The child the others created on
   the night of the electric storm
   that temporarily caused FATE
   to loosen its hold on them...

Belthasar:
   I believe you
   knew her as...
   Harle.

Member:
   ......!!!
   Unbelievable!

Belthasar:
   The Dragon Gods were
   the essence of nature
   on this planet...
   Perhaps we can consider
   what's happening as our
   planet's vengeance on
   us...
   To finally sweep away
   the unwanted humans
   from the face of this
   blue planet...

Member:
   First it was FATE,
   now it's the planet...?
   
Belthasar:
   Or vice-versa... But either
   way you look at it, now's
   the time to set things right.
   The future of mankind...
   The destiny of this planet...
   Everything depends on the
   next battle you will fight.

Belthasar:
   But unfortunately
   the time for us to
   part has come...

 [Crono]
   Hey, mister!
   Is that the Chrono Cross
   you guys have there?

   What?
   You guys don't have
   the Chrono Cross?

   The Chrono Cross...
   The melody and harmony...

   It has the power to cross
   space and time and unify
   people's thoughts and feelings...

   It has the power to
   transfer memories...
   
   By using it as an Element,
   it has the power to draw on the
   sounds of the six colored Elements
   to produce a healing harmony...

   It has the power to combine
   the sounds of the world
   into one melody...

Belthasar:
   I'm sure we'll meet again
   soon, in one time period
   or another...
   Be careful now...
   And good luck...!

 [Dragon God]
   In order to survive,
   all living things in this world

   fight desperately and
   devour those they defeat...

   Must one kill other living
   things in order to survive?
   
   Must one destroy another world
   in order to allow one's own
   world to continue?

   The wounded in turn wound
   and torment those weaker
   than they themselves are...

   There are only the killers and
   the killed...
   The sinners, who are judged, and
   the victims that do the judging...

   What meaning is there
   to such a world?

Kid:
   Whether there's
   meanin' to our
   lives or not...
   we still go on
   livin', you know!

Kid:
   You've got no right
   to deny that!
 
 [Dragon God]
   I shall cleanse this blue planet of
   you filthy humans once and for all!!
   
   Running away?
   Turning your back on fate?
   That is one option...

   Now prepare to receive your
   retribution from the planet!

Kid:
   We've gotta beat this
   bastard...no matter
   what it takes!
   
 [Dragon God]
   Now I shall truly awaken again...
   This too is destiny...
   
Belthasar:
   That thing...
   the '"Dragon God"'...
   is only a quasi-existence...
   ...A temporary form that
   the real Dragon God uses
   in order to appear within
   this dimension.

Belthasar:
   The actual Dragon God
   was consumed long ago,
   in the distant past...
   Integrated by the entity
   known as Lavos in a time
   on the other side of the
   dimensional darkness.

Belthasar:
   The Frozen Flame is a
   splinter from the extra-
   terrestrial being Lavos.
   
Belthasar:
   The one who connects with
   the Frozen Flame, in effect,
   links with Lavos itself.

Belthasar:
   As the mediator between Lavos
   and living things, that one will
   gain extraordinary powers!
   By binding with the new
   seed of destruction...
   the '"Devourer of Time!"'

Kid:
   What in blazes is
   a Devourer of Time!?

Member:
   What in the world's
   A Devourer of Time!?
 
 [Belthasar?]
   Now, go to the place where time
   became divided and weave the
   threads of time together again...
   Chrono Trigger!
   
Belthasar:
   The Devourer of Time
   is a new life-form...
   Born out of the fusion of a
   life-form from this planet with
   Lavos, who nests on the far
   side of the dimensional void.
   
Belthasar:
   In the far-off future, when
   the fusion becomes complete,
   IT will awaken...
   
Belthasar:
   Then, the Devourer of Time
   will begin to consume all
   space-time continua...
   Despair and hatred...
   To return all things to
   nothingness...
   That is what IT desires.
 
Belthasar:
   Here...
   Take this with you.
  
   [Member] received
   the Time Egg!

Belthasar:
   That Time Egg will
   enable you to travel
   beyond space-time...

   in your hands...
   Go!
   Release the life
   that is imprisoned...

   Terra Tower's
   final, true form...
   
Member:
   All life-forms dream
   of being greater,
   more powerful...

Member:
   We've come this far.
   All that remains
   is to defeat
   the Devourer of Time.
   Once we wipe
   the Devourer of Time
   off the face of this
   planet, it's all over!
   Hopefully everything
   will go back to
   normal again...

Kid:
   You're wrong...
   Things won't ever go back
   to the way they were!
   Destiny...
   '"Fate"'...
   is dead!
   
Kid:
   From now on, us humans
   have to choose our own
   way in life...
   We also have to take
   responsibility for the
   choices we do make.
   And somethin's gotta
   be done about the way
   we go on hurtin' and
   killin' one another!
   We've gotta settle our
   differences once and
   for all!

Kid:
   Listen...
   What's really important
   is what we do now...
   The issue ain't whether we
   defeat that bastard or not!
   I'm afraid that, dependin'
   on how we go about it, we
   could lose out on gainin'
   somethin' real precious...
   So the issue is the way we
   fight!
   
Member:
   So where on earth
   is the real
   Devourer of Time?
   
Kid:
   My guess is the key to
   findin' it lies at that
   beach...
   That's where this whole
   thing started.
   It's also probably where
   this whole thing'll end.

   Father suddenly got sick
   and fell asleep...
   He hasn't woken up
   since...
   ......
   He looks very peaceful...
   That's my only relief.

Lisa:
   Father,
   he must have become
   tired of it all...
   I've been selfish, and...
   I haven't helped out
   much at the store...
   Sob...
   I'm sorry,
   I'm sorry, father...
   I couldn't do anything...
   Even during the hard times
   after mother passed away...
   
Leena:
   Lisa...
   Don't blame yourself so much.
   Your father must want to
   wake up from his sleep.
   But something is stopping him.
   I can feel it...
   So please, try be your normal,
   cheerful self, alright?

 [Opassa Beach (Home)]
 
 [Lucca]
   So you finally made it,
   Serge...

   When did this sorry tale
   all begin...?
   Was it 10 years ago, when
   you almost drowned here?
   Or was it 14 years ago, when
   you were wounded by that
   panther demon that attacked
   you...
   ...resulting in you being
   carried to Chronopolis where
   you came into contact with
   FATE and the Frozen Flame...?
   Or perhaps it was even 2,400
   years in the future, when the
   Time Crash hurled Chronopolis
   back to prehistoric times?
   Or even it could have been
   12,000 B.C., when an ancient
   magical kingdom met its end
   after trying to use Lavos...?

   Each is close to being
   correct...
   And yet, at the same time,
   so far from the right answer!
   The true beginning was during
   the destruction of the ancient
   Kingdom of Zeal!
   As the palace collapsed around
   her, Princess Schala was sucked
   into a dimensional vortex along
   with the Lavos Mammon Machine.
   Schala and Lavos became unified
   into one even more powerful
   entity that would evolve into
   the Devourer of Time.
   Filled with the hatred and
   sadness of Lavos, half of
   Schala's mind became set on
   destroying all of existence.
   Yet at the same time, the
   other half of her mind
   desired to save the universe
   and to be rescued herself.
   As Schala fell through the
   time gate in this condition,
   she heard your crying
   echoing through time...
   That is when her story and
   yours began to intertwine...
   It is also when the past and
   the future began to intersect,
   and when the world became
   divided into two...
   Led by the pitiful crying
   the young Serge made as
   the panther demon's poison
   took hold of him...
   Princess Schala traveled ten
   thousand years in time to try
   and make contact with this
   dimension!
   This caused a raging magnetic
   storm that resulted in FATE's
   system malfunction, which led
   Serge to the Frozen Flame.

   Yes, Serge...
   The sound of your crying
   touched the heart of
   Princess Schala...
   Before the destructive mind-
   set could become dominant,
   she cloned herself and sent
   her copy into this dimension.
   Schala left her baby
   daughter-clone with her
   ancient pendant, possessing
   magical powers.
   This was to safeguard her
   daughter-clone in life-and-
   death situations.
   The pendant would rewind
   time a little, sending her
   daughter-clone into a safer
   point in the immediate past.

   That's right...
   Kid is Schala's
   daughter-clone!

Kid:
   You're wrong! I'm me!
   I ain't no Schala's
   daughter or clone!

   ......
   Yes, that's right Kid!
   If that's how you feel...
   I think Princess Schala
   would have wanted it to
   be that way too!
   
Kid:
   ......
   
 [Lucca]
   And now, about '"Project Kid"'...
   the time control project
   Belthasar planned out.
   The whole project existed to
   lead you to this one, special
   point in time!
   The founding of Chronopolis,
   the Time Crash, and the
   battle between FATE and
   the Dragon Gods...
   It was all coordinated so
   that you would get your
   hands on the Chrono Cross
   and come to this place!

   Of course, Kid was not to
   know anything about this
   whole plan until later,
   when all this will finish.
   Further in the future, Kid
   is meant to travel back ten
   years in time from now to
   save Serge from drowning.
   And then, Kid was also
   meant to call Serge into the
   other world as he spoke with
   Leena here on Opassa Beach!
   
   You're our last hope...
   Our final chance...
   Only you, who came into
   contact with Schala, and
   Kid, Schala's clone-
   daughter, can do it!
   In the darkness that exists
   on the other side of time,
   Schala has been integrated
   with the Devourer of Time!
   Please, Serge!
   Release Princess Schala
   from the binds of that
   monster and her own hatred!
   Show us, the life-forms
   that exist on this planet,
   what our new future will
   be...

Kid:
   ......
   
 [Lucca]
   Sorry for making you sad,
   Kid...
   You see, we no longer
   exist in this time line.
   But it is a relief to see
   that you have grown into
   such a fine looking lady!
   But of course you're
   beautiful! After all...
   you're the Great Lucca's
   '"little sister!"'
   
   Kid:
   ......
   Sis...

   Well good luck, Kid!
   Give it your best shot!
   Show us, the life-forms
   that exist on this planet,
   what our new future will
   be...
 
 [Lucca]
   Attaboy, Serge!
   Use the Time Egg to open
   the gateway to the great
   unknown...
   Show us, the life-forms
   that exist on this planet,
   what our new future will
   be...
 
 [Marle]
   A new species is about to be
   born on this planet -- an
   alien life-form even more
   evolved than the old Lavos!
   At the darkness beyond time,
   the weakened Schala came under
   the influence of Lavos, and
   the two became one entity.
   It is now up to you, the one
   whom the Frozen Flame has
   chosen as its '"arbiter"'...
   You alone can decide how
   the new Lavos, which has
   encaged Schala within it,
   will evolve from here!
   Your actions will determine
   whether in the future all time
   is devoured by Lavos, sending
   the world into everlasting death.
   Belthasar foresaw this was
   going to happen, in his world
   in the year 2300.
   And he was determined to
   prevent it from happening,
   no matter what it took...

   The Chrono Cross...
   It alone can combine the sounds
   of the planet that the six
   types of Elements produce!
   The melody and harmony that
   brim within all life-forms...
   Use the '"song of life"' to heal
   her enmity and suffering...
   We entreat you, Serge!
   Please save Schala...
   
   Please! 
   Use the song of life
   to heal her enmity
   and suffering...
   You're the only one
   that can do it!
 
 [Crono]
   Where even angels lose
   their way...
   Ten years ago, you died
   at this very spot.
   There's no mistake.
   You drowned.
   The truth is, this world,
   in which you are still
   alive, is the irregularity...
   This is the false reality!

   Ten years ago, it was Lynx
   who tried to kill you at
   this beach.
   After Prometheus broke the link
   between FATE and the Flame,
   FATE tried to eliminate any
   obstacle that stood in its way!
   In the meantime, the six
   Dragons had sent Harle
   forth to try and gain
   possession of the Flame.
   Harle made contact with
   FATE's biological incarnation,
   Lynx, and tricked him into
   temporarily joining forces.
   The elimination of the
   Prometheus circuit's lock
   on the Frozen Flame was
   everyone's top priority!

   Lynx and Harle abducted
   Lucca, who alone could
   release the Prometheus lock
   that guarded the Flame...
   But the whole attempt only
   ended in failure.
   Then, they just waited for
   you to appear instead!
   You see, FATE calculated that
   you would one day cross
   the dimensions and try to
   make contact with the Flame.

   I don't know how to break
   this to you, but...
   Lynx was actually your
   father, Wazuki!
   Drawing closer to the Flame
   caused him to become unstable,
   and the image of you dying in
   terror changed him completely!
   Finally, after having his
   psyche totally eroded,
   he lost his soul and was
   easily integrated by FATE...
   FATE turned Wazuki into a
   biological interface, modelling
   him after your worst fear at
   the time -- a panther.
   Although Wazuki managed to
   escape from Chronopolis with
   you, he later completely
   succumbed to FATE.
   Humans are such fragile,
   disjointed, imperfect things.
   Love and hate...
   Life and death...

   Perhaps even FATE itself
   dreamed of using the Flame
   to some day reincarnate
   itself into a new species.
   It is quite sad, really...
   It's like when you gaze
   into the Flame, the Flame
   gazes back into you.
   
   It's now up to you to decide
   how you want to live.
   You are the new Chrono Trigger!
 
 [Lucca]
   That's the amulet Kid
   always had so dear to her
   heart!
   If you look carefully you'll
   see that the design on the
   cloth bag is the ancient
   kingdom's royal crest.
   Inside the bag is a
   wooden pendant.
   I assume my little sister
   had it with her, or picked
   it up later. on the night
   my house was razed.
   I bet she carefully kept
   it with her, always...
   I'm sure it has a lot of
   memories attatched to it!
 
 [Lucca]
   The Time Egg...
   The ancient sage, Gasper,
   once called it the Chrono
   Trigger, you know!?
   Each of us allows our
   feelings to be a trigger...
   Letting them loose changes
   our world, time, and history!

Miki:

Kid:

   You don't wanna keep the
   girl waiting any longer...
   She's been waitin' for you,
   and only you!
   And for over ten thousand
   years, I might add!

Kid:
   If the world's gonna
   be destroyed, then let
   it be destroyed!
   If history is gonna be
   changed, then let it
   bloody well be changed!
   I'll show you what
   Radical Dreamers

   Thus the life force called Serge
   was not even allowed
   to be born into this world.
   Fate has no forgiveness for
   those who dare stand against it...
 
 [Schala]
   I have been waiting an eternity...
   just for this very moment...~

   Meaninglessly hurting one another...
   The disappearing life-forms...

       The words
           that become deleted...
       The thoughts
           that become buried...
       The pool of cells
           that slowly evaporate...
       The echoes of consciousness
           that slowly fade...

   Love to hate...
   Hate to love...
   Why are we born?
   Why do we die?
    
   Evolution?
   The '"survival of the fittest?"'
   What is there to be achieved from
   harming one another...
   killing one another...

   The '"eggs"' that we call planets...
   And the innumerable '"spermatozoa"'
   which gather around these
   that we call life-forms...
    
   When one of those countless seeds
   inseminates a planet,
   a new universe is born.
   
   But until that occurs,
   hundreds of millions of years will pass,
   and innumerable life-forms will be born,
   then die...

   That is the be-all and end-all.
   Everything exists for that one moment.
   All so that the universe can evolve
   into the next dimension...

   Does that make us all just pawns?
   Are each of our short lives
   nothing but a cheap sacrifice
   just so the one chosen life-form
   can be born?

   No. That is not the case!
   Each and every one of us
   has a chance of becoming
   that one chosen life-form
   which inseminates a planet.
   Yes, it could be '"you"'...
   
   Genes and environment...
   Each of us tries to do his best
   under the limited conditions
   we are each dealt.
    
   Each life-form that attempts to
   eke out a decent life for itself
   forms a link in the golden chain
   that leads to the creation of
   a new universe.

   If one link is missing,
   there will be no future.
    
   There is no such thing as
   a useless life-form...
   No such thing as
   a pawn!

   Every single thing
   in the whole of nature
   is perhaps just dreaming
   a dream of '"life"'...
    
   All of them are also
   perhaps nothing more than
   a dream dreamt by the planet
   before it is born.

   Oh, but yes...
   Eventually all dreams
   will return to Zurvan...
   to the sea of dreams...

   Serge...!
   Don't go yet, Serge...!!!
   It's alright.
   Everything is alright now.

   Time, which has been divided,
   will be unified again now.
    
   The time for farewells has come...
   You will lose all memory of
   this whole adventure
   and return to your own time.
    
   But this time, you will be able
   to live your own life!
   
Guile:
   It was an interesting
   journey, Serge...
   I will set out in
   search of a new enigma.
   Let us toast, in hopes that
   our paths may cross again...!

Norris:
   You have broadened my
   horizons, Serge!
   I sincerely hope to
   see you again!

Nikki:
   Serge...
   I must say that
   was a rockin' gig.
   I hope to jam with
   you again, sometime.
   You're always welcome with us,
   the Magical Dreamers!

Viper:
   Come see me should you
   ever need anything!
   You will make a fine
   dragoon, young man.
   God be with you!

Riddel:
   ......
   Thank you.
   You have given me
   another wonderful memory
   of my dear Dario.
   I shall never, ever forget
   my last moments with him.
   Thank you again, and
   take care, Serge...

Zoah:

   Don'tCHA think it's a nice
   feelin' havin' someone
   special to go home to?
   Be good, Serge!

Glenn:
   Yes! I will continue to follow
   in my brother's footsteps
   as a great dragoon!
   Good luck to you,
   Serge!
   I look forward to
   the next time we meet.

Leena:

   Thanks for being born

   I was in charge of the battle effects,
   and I was so busy, I didn't even have
   time to tend to my butt hairs.
   Just kidding! (About the butt hairs)
   But let me tell you about my goatee.
   It's not like I dye the bristles, but
   there's some red hair mixed in there.
   See?
   Black hair, black hair, red hair,
   red hair, black hair, red hair...
   
Kanji Ooiwa:
   Oh, Tsuyoshi! The player's finally here.
   Man, we sure waited a long time!
   I thought you might have called it quits.
   What? There's something you'd like
   to discuss? Mix jello...with...
   And a bomber jack will appear...
   To place a rubber band on your cup...?
   What on earth are you talking about!?
   Listen, you're not getting any younger,
   so stop playing games all the time and
   spend some time with your daughter.

Richard Honeywood:
   Whom do you want
   me to impersonate?
   (Pick a number206 1-43)
   ~~~00~
   
Richard Honeywood:
   I work at SQUARE in
   Tokyo where I "live"
   with the Chrono Cross team.
   I was the Localization
   Director, the Localization
   Programmer, and one of
   the translators.
   One interesting feature of
   this game is its automatic
   accent generation ability.
   Without this system...
   all the text for the 43 main
   characters wouldn't have
   fit into the game, making an
   English version impossible!
   I created an English
   auto-accent system where we
   could just write the plain
   translation and...
   leave it up to the program
   to convert it real-time into
   the "voice" of whoever's
   speaking at the time. So...
   I am also responsible
   for all those funny speech
   impediments that we're sure
   drove you crazy!
   But I bet you never
   realized they were auto-
   generated, right? Anyway,
   see you later, Serge!
   
'"Sammy"' (Shigeto Matsushima):
   Hi! I'm one of the Localization
   Specialists at SQUARESOFT who worked
   on the US version of Chrono Cross.
   First off, congratulations on
   clearing the game and finding
   this room!
   I hope you've enjoyed the world
   of Chrono Cross and its strange...
   (Ahem!)...'"unique"' inhabitants.
   As our Localization Director,
   Richard, mentioned, this game
   would not have been possible
   without his auto-accent system.
   Having more than 40 main characters
   was a challenge to us, and it was
   hard to keep characterization
   consistent throughout the game.
   But overall, we managed to
   give each of them distinct
   characteristics, without sacrificing
   consistency in the common lines.
   The same lines you saw when you played
   with one party combination will appear
   differently if you take different members
   to the same location. Try it out!
   If you've enjoyed the game, send your
   donations to yours truly at P.O. Box...
   Just kidding!!!
   But seriously, please tell your
   friends about this game, and invite
   them into the wonderful world of
   Chrono Cross! Thanks!

'"Teddy"' (Yutaka Sano):
   Shake it, baby!!!
   Erk it!
 
 [Room]
   Noriko Saito:
   Well, I think I'll play again.
   This time, I'm taking a
   different character along!
   Chrono Cross is so much fun!
   There are so many characters
   to choose from!

Kiyoshi Tsuchiya:
   I was in charge of the field map.
   I hope you enjoyed the
   world of Chrono Cross.
   Keep on playing to find
   all the hidden field maps!
   
Yoshiyuki Oku:
   I handled the battle animation, sometimes...
   I worked really hard, sometimes...
   I slept, sometimes...
   I was frustrated, sometimes...
   Well, I guess we're finished,
   or not...?
   Next time, I hope to improve the animation,
   or not...?
   In any case, I plan to live
   a lovely life for now.

Takashi Wakou:
   Many people come and go.
   Which brings me to the following:
   '"As long as time and space is in
   accord with me, then everything is fine."'
   This is what the other me is saying.
   That's how I felt about the project.
   I'm glad I was able to meet the other me.

Tsuguharu Aoki:
   Alright! Chrono Cross is complete!
   Good job, everyone!
   Good job to me, too!
   It was really great working
   with the Chrono Cross team.
   Teamwork is a beautiful thing.
   I was also happy about the average
   age of the team members being so high.
   Born in 1967, I'm starting to
   worry about my waist size.
 
 [Room]
   Masahiro Kabe:
   Thanks a lot for playing
   Chrono Cross.
   Hope to see you again, somewhere...

Noriko Mitose:
   This music seems
   so distant, yet so close...
   From  dream, long ago...
   They remind me of a season.
   How I was able to meet and
   accomplish something.
   I hope to meet again.
   A message I leave behind...
   '"Thank you."'

Yoshitsugu Saito:
   The magnificent story of the planet
   has ended, and a new journey unfolds.
   At the end of the eternal journey is...
   ......Anyway,
   there are so many sub-events in
   this game, you won't be able to see
   all of them the first time around.
   The course of action you take
   and the choices you make may
   reveal new events.
   Play the heck out of Chrono Cross!

Yusuke Kigoshi:
   Phew... Looks like
   we finally made it.
   What kept me going was
   envisioning the expression
   on your face while you
   played the game.
   Did you enjoy it?
   ~~~Of course I did!
   ~~~It was awesome!

Yusuke Kigoshi:
   Really...
   I'm glad to hear that!
   Thank you very much
   for playing.
   But I'm not too sure
   about the name Serge...
   Well, I hope you're looking
   forward to our next project!

Hiroki Chiba:
   Hello, everybody!
   Just like in the original, I was in
   charge of the events for Chrono Cross.
   This time around, there were lots of
   characters. (How many did you all get?)
   It was a really difficult task for me
   to come up with that many events.
   But since all the characters had their own
   unique personality and style, it made
   my work a lot of fun. Who did you all like?
   My favorite is...a secret.
 
 [Room]

Hitoshi Oguchi:
   I did all the character animations.
   Like the character you're controlling now!
   And a whole bunch of deadly ones!
   I'm sorry if they were over your head!
   I hope there was at least one
   character you liked. Well, see ya!

Norikazu Sato:
   I made all the various creatures
   of this world. And there were plenty,
   let me tell you!
   Actually, the character you're controlling
   now, and the others around you, all
   started off as one tiny little gray box.
   Well, I hope to see you
   again in another world!
   Bye!

Sentaro Hotta:
   Hey, how's it goin'!?
   I was in charge of magic and other effects.
   Man, am I burned out...
   My memories of the summer of 1999...
   I was at the beach...in my dreams...
   It was a nice, amusing dream, except...
   for the sea of blood... Heh heh...
   And lastly, here's some advice to all
   my friends, young and old!
   Don't cast any magic with your nose
   pressed against the TV screen!

Yufuko Hatae:
   I did some battle effects and worked on
   Pip's design. I joined the team midway,
   but I feel good about what I accomplished.
   Some of my memorable moments were
   watching the sunrise and fireworks
   outside our office window,
   and a late night trip to the video
   store in Ebisu to rent '"Flamenco."'
   I need to add variety to my daily routine.
   Do you think we'll meet again?

Mika Nunokawa:
   Why did we have so
   many characters?
   That's what I kept asking
   myself when I was drawing
   all of them...
   Oh well...

   Pure darkness...
   Oh, how beautiful.
   Mwa hahahah hah...

Dark Uchimichi:
   Don't shy away from darkness.
   You must face it.
   Mwa hahahah hah...

Masataka Hata:
   I'm responsible for the monster animation.
   To anyone who wins battles with ease:
   How about some monster-watching by
   using the Defend command?
   You might see a power move
   you've never seen before.
   But I won't take responsibility
   if you see the words GAME OVER
   by doing so. Take care.

Kiyoshi Yoshii:
   We're finally done.
   Aaaah, I can sleep in peace.
   Hey, you should get
   some rest, too,
   you know that?
   Good night......
   and RESET...

Ko Arai:
   Thanks for playing.
   I really mean it.

Hikaru Anzai:
   I worked really hard on the movies.
   So hard, in fact, that I got
   blisters on my fingers from
   all the texturing.
   We all worked really hard on them,
   so be sure to watch them!

Yoichiro Hori:
   It's important to push
   when you can't pull.

Kazuhiro Hasegawa:
   There are many people in various places.
   You act differently towards many.
   You're always searching for yourself.
   What kind of '"you"' do you like?
   And what kind of '"you"' do you want to be?
   I hope you find the right '"you."'
   Good luck to you.
   ......
   This is according to specification!

Ryosuke Aiba:
   I made a lot of monsters.
   Over 100, actually!
   But because they're monsters,
   every one of them will be defeated.
   That's kinda sad, really...
   They didn't do anything wrong.
   Don't tell me you...
   Nah, you wouldn't do such a terrible thing.

   ...Ummm, and everyone else...
   And to all of you who played
   Chrono Cross:
   I did it! Yeah! I did it!

Yukio Nakatani:
   Thanks for playing all the way through.
   Did you enjoy it? Anyone who's confused
   should play again. Anyone who wants to
   know about the sequel...
   Wait 2 more years...
   Just kidding.

Tomoko Murakami:
   Heee... I really like him...
   That '"man with the goatee."'
   Dressed in black, on a southern island!
   What?
   He's too hairy?
   He's bald under that hat!?
   ..................Heee!
   That's what I like about him!

   Boy, it sure was tough.
   Dealing with odd and even numbers...
   Huh? The flickering?
   Oh, it's supposed to be that way...

Yoshiyuki Miyagawa:
   I programmed the visual effects. Due to
   the magnificent work of the designers,
   the quality was surprisingly excellent.
   I hope my programs will really add to
   the game so that you may further
   indulge in the world of Chrono Cross.
   I hope you feel your time playing
   this game was well spent.
   Please enjoy the extra features

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   Hello, people!
   I'm Katsuhisa, and I'm a
   programmer.
   Unlike the artists, musicians,
   and scenario writers, etc., we
   programmers don't stand out
   that much, I guess.
   So today I thought I'd teach
   you folks just what a program
   is!
   Hold on while I call some of
   my friends!
   Heeeey yooouuu guuuuuysss!!!!

Kazumi Kobayashi:
   Hi. I'm Kazumi.
   Nice to meet you.
   
Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   Kazumi programmed the
   sections that display and
   maneuver Polygon Models.
   Why don't you show 'em,
   Kazumi...?

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   That was "moving!"
   Who's next?

Yoshiyuki Miyagawa:
   I guess that's me...
   You can call me Miya!

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   Miya wrote the program
   sections that manipulate
   "Effects"...
   His "Effects" look like
   this...

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   Mighty "effective,"
   don't you think?
   And lastly, but not
   leastly, we have...

Kohji Ohno:
   OHNO!!!
   No, I'm not in trouble
   ...that's my name!

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   He coded the "Special Effects"
   used in the battles, as well
   as the menu system's program.
   Go for it, Ohno!

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   How "handy!"

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   Oh, and as for me...
   Well, I was responsible for
   the overall Battle Program.
   Why, I even wrote the data
   and functions that allow
   this image of me to talk
   to you like this!
   The artificial intelligence
   and logic of the monsters
   and other enemies was also
   written by yours truly.

Katsuhisa Higuchi:
   Thanks for listening to my
   long speech here.
   Oh, and I really appreciate
   that you bought a copy of
   Chrono Cross, too!
   Well, until we meet again
   in some other game, take

   I was in charge of creating the field

Peppor:

Peppor:

Pierre:

Leena:
   Come on, Lisa!
   What are you doing!?
   We won't be able to get
   good seats if we don't
   leave now!

Lisa:
   I'm sorry.
   I seem to have
   misplaced the tickets.
   Where could they be?
   
Leena:
   What!?
   I don't believe this...
   Hurry up and find them!
   We'll be standing all the way
   in the back at this rate!

Leena:
   But I never knew
   she was so talented.
   Nikki was almost
   begging her to join.

Lisa:
   What amazes me is
   that he picked her...
   Why didn't he pick me?
   
Leena:
   My, my...
   Don't we have an ego...

Lisa:
   Anyway, I still can't
   find the tickets.
   Wait! I found them!
   (I shouldn't tell her
    they were in my pocket...)
   OK, Leena!
   Let's go!!!
   
Leena:
   Yeah, come on!
   We have to hurry!
   
Lisa:
   Wait for me!
   I'm the one with
   the tickets!

 [Lisa's Dad]

   some yelling out here.

   There's so much hustle and
   bustle outside... Is there
   something going on today?

   Nah-nah!
   
Harle:

   Nah-nah!
   
 [Demi-human]
   Hah hah hah haha!
   
 [Demi-human Woman]
   Hi, Lynx!
   Hi, Harle!

Harle:
   Good morning!
   
 [Demi-human Woman]
   Listen, I was wondering
   if you could go do some
   shopping for me?
   I'll give you a discount!
   
Harle:
   Sure, but maybe
   later, non?
   
Harle:

Harle:
   So, what iz ze
   agenda for today?
   
Harle:
   Hm?

Harle:
   Good morning, Sage!

Sage:
   Oh, good morning,
   Lynx, Harle.
   
Sage:
   You two seem to fit in
   quite nicely after
   several months here.
   The restoration program
   is coming along fine.
   Thanks to you two, of course.

Harle:
   Zere iz not'ing Monsieur
   Lynx cannot do, non?

Sage:
   Hahahahah.
   I was hoping you
   would say that.
   There is something
   I would like to discuss.

Harle:
   Oui?
   What iz it?

Sage:
   Hmmm...
   Well, as you probably know,
   life in Marbule is beginning
   to center around you.
   Unlike before, everybody
   is generating a positive
   attitude.
   This may be a golden opportunity
   to bring about a change to
   our dated way of thinking.
   I am sure we will have to
   associate with the humanfolks
   on equal terms now.
   I believe it is time
   for a new leader.
   I am too old for this.

Harle:
   Are you saying...

Sage:
   Yes, exactly.
   Once you become the leader
   of Marbule, the way we
   demi-humans view the world
   will change for the better...
   I believe you will be able
   to bring forth a new age in
   the history of demi-humans.

Harle:
   Looks like you've kept
   an eye on him!
   Well, Monsieur Lynx?
   How about it?
   Of course, I will help, too.

Sage:
   You do not have to
   answer right away.
   Stay here as long as you
   want to consider my offer.
   But keep in mind, everybody
   looks up to you and needs you.

Sage:
   Good day.

Harle:
   Monsieur Lynx...
   You will find un way to
   get your old self back.

Harle:
   But until zen, let'z do
   what we can for ze
   demi-humans here, non?

Harle:
   You are needed here.
   No matter how you look on
   ze outside, you are you!
   And zat iz what iz important.
   Everybody iz looking
   to you for guidance.
   You can do it, Monsieur Lynx...
   I know you can!

   Don't worry,
   I will be by your side...

   Serge...
 
 [Pearly Gates]
   
Serge:
   Well, well, well...
   If it isn't the
   3 old farts...
   I'll hear what you
   have to say...
   
Radius:
   Listen well!
   The countless evil deeds

   cannot go unpunished!
   We can no longer allow

   Prepare yourself!

Zappa:
   Ah hear ye be the bastard
   that killed all the
   dragoons dead.
   That's why ah'm here,

Fargo:

   You're nothin' but a disgrace!

Serge:

   I really don't have time to
   deal with the likes of you...
   
Kid:
   Oi! I ain't gonna let
   you get in the way of
   Serge's plan!

Serge:
   That's the way it goes...
   But I do need to get

   I'll make a special exception
   today, and take you on as well.

Kid:

   Looks like we've got company.
   I'll hold 'em off here.
   You go on ahead, Serge.

Serge:

Harle:
   You're......I see...
   I am in a hurry.
   Would you mind letting
   me through, pleaze?
   
Kid:
   Hah!
   It'll take a little more than
   a '"pleaze"' to let you through.
   Over my dead body, I say!

Harle:
   Kid!
   It iz senseless
   for us to fight!
   We must stop Serge...
   I mean, Monsieur Lynx!
   
Kid:
   Quit tryin' to talk
   yer way out of it!
   I don't like you.
   It's as simple as that!
   I don't care if it is
   senseless for us to fight!

Harle:
   D'accord...

   cannot be helped...

Dario:
   Ahahaha!
   Look! The kids are
   bursting with joy!
   It's hard to believe we
   live in a barbarous world.

Dario:
   These are the kids that will
   shape the next generation.
   I am sure the general is
   in full agreement.
   
Dario:
   Isn't that right, sir?

Viper:
   Hmm?
   Well, ummm...
   Ahahahahaha!
   
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Shall we start a
   dragoon youth group, sir?

Dario:
   Ahahahahaha!

 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Ahahahahaha!

Dario:
   We must keep it a secret
   from Riddel, though.

Dario:
   Ahahahahaha!
   
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   What do we do about the
   operating costs, sir?

Dario:
   No need to worry.
   I have an idea.

 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Oh, you mean...

Dario:
   We must keep it a secret
   from Riddel, though.

Dario:
   Ahahahahaha!
   
Riddel:
   Hmm? What is it?
   What is so amusing?

   somewhere we can rest
   in this town...?
   
Harle:
   I t'ink zat bar
   may be open.

Serge:
   Aaaah...yes.
   It's hard to believe such a
   place would still be in business
   during these wretched times.
   Well, good for us, I suppose.
   We may also be able to gather
   some information...

   you're dealing with...!
   
Serge:
   Hey, this price is
   ridiculous!
   I'll sue you, you know!
   ......!?

Zoah:
   NO...
   YOU DO NOT KNOW WHO
   YOU ARE DEALING WITH.

 [Dark Serge]
   !!!
   A rip-off joint!?
   I don't believe this!!!

Karsh:
   Gah hah hah hah...
   Easy money...

Marcy:
   Looks like we'll meet
   our quota for this month.

Karsh:
   Yeah...
   But still, all I wanna know is
   when we can start wreaking
   some havoc again! I'm not cut
   out for this kinda stuff!

Marcy:
   So you say, but I know you
   enjoy being the ladies' man...

Karsh:
   W-Whatever!

 [Ending 10 - Return of the Downtrodden]
 
 [Sky Dragon Isle]
 
 [Dragon God]
   Finally...
   
Dwarf Chieftain:
   Oh, almighty Dragon God...
   The remaining survivors of my clan
   have all gathered on this island!
   
Sage:
   The demi-humans of Marbule
   have gathered as well.

 [Dragon God]
   Excellent.
   The time is nigh...

   Those who defy our plans
   have been eliminated.

   Not a soul can
   interfere now...

   Let us stain the planet
   with the blood of humanity...
   
   The impudent humans who believe
   they are the sole rulers...

Sage:
   Dragon God...
   Do we have no
   other alternative?

Dwarf Chieftain:
   What are you talking about!?
   Have you forgotten their
   wicked deeds, hi-ho!?
   If we do not do something
   about this now, the humans will
   certainly destroy this planet!

Sage:
   But...

 [Dragon God]
   Now, be off.
   Eliminate these foolish
   mortals who are eating
   away at the planet.
   
   It is our turn to
   dream anew with
   the planet...

Dwarf Chieftain:
   Certainly, oh Dragon God!
   
Sage:
   ......

Dwarf Chieftain:
   Hi-hoooooo!
   Prepare for the worst,
   you filthy HUMANS!
   Now where should we
   begin the bloodbath!?
   Hi-hoooooo!
   
Sage:
   ......

Sage:
   ...Are we doing
   the right thing...?

 [Dragon God]
   Humans...
   Let this be a lesson for the
   countless sins you have committed
   over the past thousand years...
   
   There is no turning back now...
 
 [Arni]
 
 [Harle]
   How many yearz haz it been
   since I last vizited...?
   
Harle:
   Sigh...

Harle:
   ......
 
 [Demi-human Man]
   I had such a blast
   watchin' those humans
   run for their lives!
   Hah hahaha!
 
 [Demi-human]
   They were always lookin'
   down upon us demi-humans.
   I'd pay a million G's to see
   their faces filled with fear,
   humiliation, and disgrace again!
   
 [Demi-humans]
   Hehehehehe!

   Hahahahahah!
 
 [Demi-human Woman]
   Oh, I can't use these
   filthy utensils after a
   human has touched them.

   Don't you agree?

Harle:
   ......
 
 [Demi-human Woman]
   Gather around, ladies!
   I brought with me today...
   utensils, direct from Marbule!
   They're clean, and they
   last forever!

   Oh my! Wonderful!
   How much are they?
 
 [Dwarf]
   El Nido is finally at peace
   now that the humans are gone.

 [Dwarf]
   But what if troops from the
   mainland are sent to survey
   the area?
   
 [Dwarf]
   Hi-ho, the Dragon God
   is watching over us.
   Humans are no match
   for us, now.
   
Harle:
   ......
   ...Hmmm...

Harle:
   I wonder if theze
   flowerz will do...?

 [Frozen Flame Lines]
 
Kid:
   An ancient magical kingdom...?
   That you destroyed
   ten thousand years ago...?
   What are ya talkin' about?
   
   Kid:
   Stop it...
   I don't know nothin'!
   
   I'm...
   I'm Kid!!
   I'm myself and
   nobody else!!

Guile:
   Is this what I have
   been searching for
   all this time...
   No...
   Stop it!
   I am no such thing.
   What good is it...
   to possess such
   dark power...?

Norris:
   If I take this with me back
   to Porre, there will be
   even more bloodshed.
   And yet, it will give us
   enough power to withstand
   the other major countries.
   Is that all I have really
   desired this whole time...?
 
Nikki:
   Marvelous...
   It's a truly marvelous
   tone...
   It brings out light
   and darkness within
   me clearly!

Viper:
   Hmm...
   Good Lord!
   Is there nothing more
   to life than destroying
   and defeating one
   another after all...?

Viper:
   And only then shall living
   beings advance forward,
   to a higher level?
   The '"survival of the fittest?"'
   Is that the true meaning of
   evolution?

Riddel:
   What an awfully sad
   light...
   As long as we are alive,
   it is impossible to avoid
   partings.
   If that is so, then
   perhaps it would be
   better if one did not
   meet others at all...
   Excuse me?
   No! It cannot be...
   Is it you...?
   It is you!
   Oh, I am so relieved.
   You were always by my
   side, and yet I never
   noticed...

Karsh:
   For crying out loud...
   Stop it!
   I know that already!
   Don't read my mind
   any further than that!

Zoah:
   HMPH!
   WHAT MEANING IS THERE TO
   A LIFE OF STRIVING AFTER
   WEALTH AND POWER...?
   IT IS NO USE TO YOU ONCE
   YOU DIE!
   AS FOR ME, I CHOOSE TO
   LIVE IN BATTLE AND ONE
   DAY TO DIE IN BATTLE.
   
Marcy:
   What?
   Oh, I already knew that...
   I know that half of the
   blood within me is that
   of a demi-human...
   And I know that it'll be
   easier for me if I can
   accept that fact...
   What are you, my school
   counselor or something?
   Like, tell me something
   I don't know...

Korcha:
   HotCHACHA!
   This is greatCHA!
   It feels like
   firecrackers
   are going off
   in my head.

Korcha:
   I getCHA...
   I understand it now!
   All living things are
   really connected in
   their hearts!
   There's nothing to
   worry about.
   
Luccia:
   Ack!
   Vot power...
   Dis power is not somet'ing
   man should possess.
   yes...it is just as I t'ought.
   Several civilizations have
   already been destroyed
   because of dis immense power...
   As you said, my friend...
   Science should only be used
   for the betterhood of mankind,
   no!?

Poshul:
   Why can't we all
   be friendth?
   Ith that tho hard to do?

Poshul:
   Watch out.
   Me won't lose againtht
   any big, bad, ugry enemy!
   
Razzly:
   I can hear the voices of
   the trees and flowers...
   They are just like humans.
   They are all hurt and are
   all sad.
   We are all life born
   from this planet...

Zappa:
   Aye... These auld bones have
   seen countless faces of the
   flame in mah lifetime...
   But with this un, ah cannae
   say ah've ever seen more
   pure and genuine hatred...

Orcha:
   The one that's hidin' within
   me is not '"another me"'...
   It's just another '"part of me."'
   I am who I am...
   Including my dark side.
   It isn't right to think of my
   other side as a separate
   entity whom I can criticize...
   Rather, I must accept who I
   am as a whole...
   
Radius:
   Ooh...
   With this power, even an
   old knight like me could...
   No!
   This is the same as what
   happened before, with the
   hatred of the Masamune.
   Oh, Garai...forgive me!
   I almost made the same
   grave mistake.
   What was that...?
   You say it is behind us now?
   Is that you, Garai...?
   Have you forgiven me...?

Fargo:
   Ha ha ha!!
   Arrgh, what are you
   trying to tell me, Flame?
   You say that we are all
   born in sin and all die
   in sin?
   Well, I say that is why we
   should continue to sin,
   then....
   Ha ha ha ha ha!
   Yet, is not the very
   reason we go on living so
   that we can make ammends
   for our sins!?
   
Macha:
   Why can't we all just be
   happy for once?
   If only we could all hold
   hands and live together
   in peace and harmony?
   Why can't people
   understand this...?

Glenn:
   You have no right
   to say such a thing!
   I am my own person!
   I will choose my own
   destiny with my own
   strength...

Leena:
   Yes... Yes...
   I know that what you
   say may be true.
 
Leena:
   But it is because we
   have such a petty and
   short life...
   ...that we all live life
   to the fullest, for all
   it's worth!
   No one, including you
   -- whoever you are --
   has the right to take
   that away from us...
   
Miki:
   You say it's no use to
   live pretentiously?
   Well, I know that...
   But isn't it like me
   to live happily and
   tenaciously?

Janice:
   The monsters aren't attacking
   people randomly. They're just
   trying to protect themselves.
   So why do people have to kill
   them indiscrimately for?
   What a pitiful life we lead if
   that's what it means to live!

Draggy:
   Why can't drragons and
   humans and ever1yone
   live togetherr in peace?
   Draggy is doing his
   parrt...

Starky:
   Woowzer!
   Out of this world...!
   The liight of the big baang!
   All starts from heere and
   all ends heere...
   What liies beeyond that...?
   
Sprigg:
   This is a power I can't
   make me own...
   Hah!
   There ain't no use tellin'
   me to do anythin', chum!
   ...You don't 'ave to tell
   me nothin'!
   I knows I might've led an
   easier life if I'da been
   kinder to otherz...

Mojo:
   True love is-om here...?
   Love is-om immortal...
   Love is-om eternal...
   Love is-om illusion...?
   That can't...be-om true.
   ...Even if it is-om so., I'll
   continue-om to convey-om
   true love to all...

Turnip:
   I don't exist-eth?
   But what difference is
   there between reality
   and a dream if thou cannot
   tell-eth it is a dream?
   I think-eth, therefore
   I am-eth!
   I might be-eth part of
   some person's dream,
   but so long as I can
   think-eth, I exist-eth!
   
NeoFio:
   There is no meaning to my
   existence...
   Other life-phorms are born
   naturally, then raised to
   adulthood, give birth to
   ophspring, then die...
   Perhaps I am like that,
   in a way...

Greco:
   Wherever there is light,
   there is also shadow...
   So it is the light that
   gives birth to shadow!
   Ghetz, I now understand,
   amigo...!
   But is it too late...?
   
Skelly:
   Now that I'm dead,
   I've got nothin' to
   fear...
   But what's this
   strange feelin' I
   have when I look
   at this flame...

Funguy:
   Once I became a
   friend of the
   forest, I realized...
   Humans don't
   produce things,
   they just destroy
   things!
   It has become an
   inescapable cycle
   of destruction...
   We need to return
   to nature...
   Like it was long
   ago...
   
Irenes:
   It ist instinct
   tö despise ötter
   species.
   And ä necessity
   to preserve öne's
   öwn kind.
   Yoü säy it ist ä

Mel:
   Wow!
   How pretty!
   This is mine and
   nobody else's!
   Finder's keeper's!
   I know, I know...!
   Not everything in
   this world goes the
   way I want it to...

Leah:
   Land angry!?
   We live is bad?
   We make land
   angry?
   But Leah
   not bad!
   Leah good
   Leah!

Van:
   Mom...!?
   Is that you I see,
   Mom!?
   No, you aren't her!
   You're just showing
   me what you think I
   want to see!
   
Sneff:
   Yes.
   I know my liffe is
   ffull off mistakes.
   But I didn't know back
   then what I know now,
   so I have no regrets!

Steena:
   This is...
   divine power!
   I see...
   In order to save the
   many, the few have
   to be sacrificed...
   That is the truth...!?
   It makes us seem
   oh-so-powerless...!
   That is the reason
   why we must live
   shoulder-to-shoulder
   and hand-in-hand!

Doc:
   Humans are, like, totally
   powerless, dude!
   With crafty knowledge we
   may extend our lives a
   fraction, but we just
   extend our suffering, too.
   But in reality, all we can do
   is leave ourselves in nature's
   hands and die the way nature
   intends us to...
   That is the awesome truth!?
   Gnarly!

Grobyc:
   Complete-destruction.
   You-say-it-is-Grobyc's
   for-the-taking?
   But-what-is-left-once
   you-use-it?
   
Pierre:
   I understand now!
   A true hero knows
   fear...
   And yet while knowing
   fear, he still has the
   courage to put up a
   fight!
   If moi lack the caliber
   to be called such then
   moi will just have to
   work harder!

Orlha:
   Yes...
   I know Tia is alive!
   The Flame tells me so!
   But why are you telling
   me this...?
   What is it you are after?
   I don't understand!

Pip:
   I am evowving!
   And will keep on
   evowving...
   But what I tuwn into,
   nobody can tell...
 
 [Fortune Teller Lines]
 
 [Fortune Teller]
   Who might you be?
   Fortunes be good, fortunes be bad,
   anything from reading your destiny
   to searching for the missing, do you
   wish your fortune be read?
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No thanks

   Come back any time
   you want a reading.
   
   For crying out loud, don't call
   me if you have no business.
   I've got things to do, unlike
   you folks!!!
   
   That is all!!!
 
 [Norris]
   You work to be more
   honest more straight...
   This world is distorted
   and crooked.
   Trying to force your
   honesty on this crooked
   world may break you.
   Beware of that.
   
 [Nikki]
   The reading states that
   you are a bridge that
   connects to the other side.
   
Nikki:
   A bridge...?

 [Fortune Teller]
   Indeed.
   Two shores, that are
   separated by an
   unstoppable stream...
   It is your role to
   connect them.
 
 [Viper]
   You will continue to
   be the rightful lord
   that you are...

Viper:
   But I...

 [Fortune Teller]
   This is no fortune reading...
   It is my opinion as one who
   has lived longer than you.

 [Riddel]
   Deep devotion often makes
   the impossible possible.
   I suggest that you keep
   holding on to your purity.
   
Riddel:
   Yes...
   
 [Karsh]
   The reading says:
   A change in fashion
   will blossom a new love.

Karsh:
   What the...?
  
 [Zoah]
   I sense deep sadness
   beneath that mask of
   yours...
   In the near future,
   you, too, shall find
   your sanctuary of peace...
 
 [Marcy]
   The reading says,
   your wish will come true
   if you purge of your
   likes and dislikes...
 
 [Korcha]
   Your fortune reads,
   that it is a hopeless love...
   I'm sorry, but you've got
   to give up.

Korcha:
   Arrgh!!!
   Don't give me such boloney!
   
 [Luccia]
   You shall always be under
   the watchful eye of
   your former master...
 
 [Poshul]
   Beware of fat and of
   over-eating...
   Well, I guess that goes
   without saying.
   
Poshul:
   PO-SHU-SHU!!!
 
 [Razzly]
   Conflict can occur
   anywhere... The only
   way to be rid of conflict
   is to remove its roots.
   Nothing will be resolved
   by just glancing the
   surface.
   
 [Zappa]
   You shall encounter the
   two things you seek...
   But be careful, for one of
   them is what you seek only
   in appearance.
 
 [Orcha]
   Do not think your inner
   evil will just fade away...
   Remember that the evil
   is secreted away inside
   everyone.
   
 [Radius]
   The many lines laid before you,
   shall all merge into one...
 
 [Fargo]
   Take away the mirror of falsity
   and reflect your image on
   the mirror of truth.
   You will then regain your true self.
 
 [Macha]
   It reads that, as a mother,
   you should set an example
   for your children.
 
 [Glenn]
   If I were to equate you
   to something, you would be
   the moon.

Glenn:
   Moon...?
   
 [Fortune Teller]
   Yes, the moon.
   The moon only shines when
   there is a sun to reflect.
   The moon does not glow with
   its own light...
   But remember this!
   The moon's light is a guidepost
   to those that search in 
   the darkness of the night.
   A time will come when you will
   carry out such a role...
   Sometime in the near future.
 
 [Leena]
   It says, you will not find
   a boyfriend for a long time.
   Fortunetelling is such a
   merciless thing...

Leena:
   How rude!
 
 [Miki]
   You shall broaden your 
   horizons in the open world.
 
 [Harle]
   In your eyes, I perceive...
   both the look of a beauty 
   and the look of a beast.
   Be mindful not to bring
   about your own end.
   The truth is beginning to
   reach out to engulf you.
 
 [Janice]
   It's very rare to see
   a demi-human like you
   living such a cheerful life.
   Keep on living as cheerfully
   as you are now, and fortune
   will follow.
   
 [Draggy]
   Seek coexistence with
   other species.
   
 [Starky]
   My word!
   You are fated to
   make a grave choice.
   Whatever will be selected
   will be decided from the
   actions of those around you.
 
 [Sprigg]
   ......!
   It's been a long time,
   Lady Sprigg.
   Have you been well?

Sprigg:
   Cackle, I'ma doin' fine.
   I've finally made it back
   to the real world.
   It be swell to hang with
   youz again!
 
 [Mojo]
   There is someone...
   No a thatch of straw that
   is most dear to you
   in this vicinity...
 
 [Turnip]
   As mysterious as your birth,
   there is an equally fascinating
   fate that awaits you.
 
 [NeoFio]
   Whether your birth was
   by god's hand or random
   chance is unknowable...
   In either case, treasure
   your life.
 
 [Greco]
   When your long journey
   reaches its end...
   the heavy burden that
   rests upon your shoulders
   will be lifted at last.
 
 [Skelly]
   You, who has been revived
   from the edge of despair,
   must share your light of
   hope with all.
 
 [Funguy]
   There might be a way for you
   to return to your original
   body, but...
   It's a matter of which you prefer.
 
 [Irenes]
   When you can resolve 
   your inner struggle...
   A new hope will be born.
 
 [Mel]
   There's no need to worry...
   Your love at heart can
   be hindered by no one.
   
Mel:
   I'm n-not in love
   with anyone!
 
 [Leah]
   Wowzer!!!
   The reading says you'll
   become a glamour queen
   when you grow up!

Leah:
   Glamour queen
   good-um?

 [Fortune Teller]
   Umm...
   In a way, you can say
   it's '"good-um."'
   Ooo, I'm envious of you!
 
 [Van]
   Take good care of the
   ones who love you, my boy.

Van:
   Humph!
  
 [Sneff]
   You shall once again
   open your wings in
   the free world, says
   the fortune.
 
 [Steena]
   Hmph, it's useless
   for a spiritualist to
   have their fortune read.
 
 [Doc]
   Do not linger on your
   mistakes in the past.
   Humans must always
   look to the future...

 [Grobyc]
   I'm sorry, but I can not
   read your fortune...
   
 [Pierre]
   There are such things as
   major comebacks in this world...
   It's all about luck
   and having everything
   turn around when things
   are at their worst.
   You have that potential
   in you.
 
 [Orlha]
   You will soon find your
   missing counterpart...
 
 [Pip]
   You should seek the
   uncharted potential
   that lies within you...

 [Bend of Time Lines]
 
 [Timekeeper]
   This is the Bend of Time...
   A special battlefield, where
   monsters travel across
   dimension to gather.
   You can battle monsters that
   you may have missed...
   
 [Timekeeper]
   Hello, young lady.
   Looks to me like the god of
   combat has taken a liking to you...

Janice:
   Who, me!?

 [Timekeeper]
   Here, take this.
   You should be able to use
   it wisely, young lady.

   What'sUpDoc!
   
   the doorway to open.
 
 [God of War's Room]
 
 [God of War]
   Welcome!

   Wanna go for it?

   3 laps should be enough.
   
   One lap means,
   starting from the entrance,
   then circling the room
   clockwise along the railing.
   
   Heeey, nice circling job!
   Well, battle away!
 
 [Ozzie]
   It's been a long time since
   we've made an appearance.
   
 [Flea]
   They look pretty
   incompetent to me.
   
 [Slash]
   Yeah, but you gotta give 'em
   credit for making it inside this room.

 [Ozzie]
   We're the 3 mystical knights!

   Show us your skills!
   
 [Flea]
   Is that all you got!?

 [Slash]
   Hah!
   You disappoint me.
   
   Try again later.
   
 [Slash]
   Oh, it's you again.
   
 [Flea]
   Don't run away this time.
 
 [God of War]
   Whoo-hoo!
   Then...

   If the number of times you circle
   matches the number inside my head,
   I'll give you somethin' real nice.

   I'll only give you 3 hints.
   Well, let's make it
   less than 20 laps.

   Looks like
   the Dragon doesn't
   exist in this world.

Member:
   But Member...
   What's that thing on
   the ledge up there?
   I don't think
   we've ever seen
   a monster like
   that before...
 
 [Criosphinx]
   Let those who disturb the
   peace of the land be punished...
   
Member:
   It's coming down!
   
Criosphinx:
   'Tis foolish to challenge me...
   Let those who break my
   silence be punished...
   
Mysterious Monster:
   Quid me vis?
   I am the Criosphinx.
   And thou hast trespassed on my domain!
   Why must thou turmoil to this land bring?
   Now turmoil onto thee, I give...
   Depending on how thou meet this trial
   Thou may be allowed to alive here leave!
   However, this be an island
   to which no man has visited for aeons
   and the Criosphinx is
   grown quite bored...
   If thou possesseth the courage
   to match thy wits to mine,
   thy sins may be forgiven when
   thou answer correctly my questions six!
   Now riddle me this...
   
Criosphinx:
   Usus est magister optimus.
   Here be an easy one
   to start off with!
   Auburn nay the burn,
   Iron pyrite nay the fool,
   All that glitters is nay...
   But silence be...
   Answer my question!
   What is it I be?
   
Criosphinx:
   Verus...
   Thou art correct.
   
Criosphinx:
   Falsus...
   Thou art incorrect.
   
Criosphinx:
   Dimidium facti qui bene coepit habet.
   Well begun is half done.
   Now, here my second riddle be...
   In my anger, I see...
   Both the rag to charge at,
   And the flag to stop at.
   Blushing, I walk the royal carpet.
   Answer my question!
   What is it I be?
   
Criosphinx:
   Now riddle number three!
   Bene rem gere!
   It isn't easy being...
   A friend of the planet,
   With the jealous monster's eyes
   Giving me a sign to proceed!
   Answer my question!
   What is it I be?
   
Criosphinx:
   Thou catch on quick!
   Question four...
   Accipe!
   Mare et caelum et viola,
   Give me a melancholy gloom,
   But a first prize ribbon,
   Makes me feel I've royal blood!
   Answer my question!
   What is it I be?
   
Criosphinx:
   Velim tibi ita persuadeas...
   Just two more to go!
   Like pontoon nay the knave,
   Or Jolly Roger nay the bones,
   Even the top rank of self-defense,
   Be no protection from the Plague.
   Answer my question!
   What is it I be?
   
Criosphinx:
   Nigra in candida vertere.
   By deduction alone ye should
   my answer already know ...
   What the extorted one is bled,
   With knuckles of fear.
   The plumage of a coward when
   Faced with the hottest of heat.
   Answer my question!
   What is it I be?
   
Criosphinx:
   Sat prata biberunt!
   Gratulor felicitati tuae!
   Well done!
   Thou hast solved all of
   my riddles!
   Thy brains are as strong
   as thy brawn!

   Bene vale! Bene valeto!
   Always be diligent
   in thy practice!
   Me tibi commendo!
   Vale!
   I take my leave of you!
   Farewell!
   
Criosphinx:
   Quid est?
   Quidnam tu hominis es?
   What?
   Thou sayest thou canst
   not answer my question?
   Male factum!
   Then what have I to do
   with thee?
   Be gone from my sight!
   Abi in malem rem!

Criosphinx:
   Quid ais?
   Mira narras!
   Impressive!
   Ne'er thought I there'd be
   humans who could defeat the
   Criosphinx by force alone!
   Thy way of life intrigues me!
   To conquer all obstacles with
   brawn rather than by brain!?
   .........
   But I warn ye, woes shall
   surely befall ones such
   as thee!

   Vale!

   Beautiful day today, isn't it?
   Sure feels great outside.
   Ahhh... Just being able to
   bask in the sun all day
   sure is a nice change.
   They say the rain
   cleanses one's spirit,
   but at our age, we've had
   enough cleansing, heh-heh.
   
   Much obliged,
   but I can't
   accept that.
   Save that for
   someone special.
   
 [Old Man]
   Yes, I know. I wonder
   if those outsiders are
   back digging, now that
   the rain's let up?
   They must be conducting
   some kind of investigation
   up there in Fossil Valley.
   I can't comprehend
   outsiders.
   Why would they want to
   dig up a place like that?

 [Boy]
   Sergey!
   Check out this
   sawfish!!!

   Awesome, ain't it!?
   Poppy caught it down south,
   by the El Nido Triangle.
   Nobody likes going down
   there, though. They all
   say it's creepy.
   But this sucker
   sure looks tasty!
   Mmmmmmm......

   Yo, Serge.
   What do you think
   of this sawfish!?

   Have you ever seen
   one this size!?
   Hah!
   This has got to be
   from the legendary
   Dragon King Palace!

   Wouldn't you agree,
   Serge?
   ~~~Hah, you wish!
   ~~~You're probably right!

   Yeah...
   I guess legends are
   meant to be legends...
   Yeah, that definitely
   would've been too
   good to be true...
   
   Oh well!
   At least I know for sure
   that this one's a biggie!
   Live an honest life, and
   something good is bound
   to happen. Hahaha!

   You think so, too!?
   I knew it!
   I just knew it!
   
   If it really is true...
   then from here on out,
   happiness will be
   rolling into my life!
   Business will pick up,
   money will start pouring in...
   I'll be able to repair my roof,
   varnish my boat, buy a new sail...
   Eat as much squid gut
   pasta as I want up
   in Termina...
   Ahhh... Life is good...
   
   Yeah, right...!
   Who am I kidding?
   That would definitely
   be too good to be true!
   But thanks anyway,
   Serge.
   Hahaha... Thanks for
   playing along.
   Here's a little
   something for you.
   Give it to a girl
   you like.
   
   [Member] received
   Komodo Scale
   without lifting a finger!
   
   I wish the legend
   was true, though...
   The Dragon King Palace...
   There aren't enough
   dreams out there, lately!
   Hah!
   
   Hey, that's an amulet made
   from a lion shark tooth.
   It's huge!
   There's no doubt about it:
   that lion shark must've
   been quite huge!
   Oh, so you really did
   get it from Kiki's dad?
   Then I'm sure of it. The
   thing must've been a monster!
   Only a first class man of
   the sea like him could
   catch one that big.

 [Old Man]
   Zzzz...
   Zzzzzzz...?
   Ughh...?

   Oh, it's you, Serge.
   Beautiful day, huh?
   You caught me dozin' off there.

   By the way, Serge?
   Do you like the sea?
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~Not really...

   Oh, really?
   Yeah, the sea sure is great.
   But just remember, Serge,
   don't take the sea too lightly.
   Usually, you'll find the
   sea to be vast, deep...
   full of strength and energy,
   yet kind and gentle.
   But once it becomes angry,
   it can turn into the most
   frightening monster you've
   ever seen, engulfing everything...
   Close your eyes and
   prick up your ears.
   Can you hear the cries of
   countless men swallowed by
   the sea? The hidden secret
   the sea whispers?

   I recommend you learn to
   sense the mood of the sea.
   That's if you don't want to join
   the fellows already on the bottom.

   Oh, really...
   Well, I guess that's fine.
   You're entitled to your opinion.
   But listen to me now
   and believe me later,
   Serge.
   Life on this planet
   was born of the sea
   and will eventually
   return to it.
   Even our blood is
   mostly sea water.
   That has been the contract
   between the sea and all
   living creatures since
   ancient times.
   No one can defy
   this rule...
   Everyone will one day
   return to the sea.
   Just keep that in
   the back of your mind.
   
   Hey, Serge.
   I recommend you learn to
   sense the mood of the sea.
   One as young as you
   shouldn't end up on
   the sea floor.

   It shouldn't be too long
   now before my day will come
   to return to the sea...
   When that time comes,
   I would like to drift
   away humming a quiet tune...

   I haven't been to Water
   Dragon Isle in a while.
   You can catch great
   fishies over there!
   But I only go there
   once in a blue moon.
   I want to leave them
   in peace...
   
 [Girl]
   Hey, Sergey?
   Wanna hear a secret?
   It's about Poshul.

   ~~~Sure, tell me!
   ~~~Nah, that's OK

   Ok, but keep it a
   secret, OK?
   Ready?
   Poshul is such a pig
   when it comes to eating.
   She'll do anything if she's
   fed her favorite dish.
   Very unlady-like,
   isn't it?
   Tempted by food...

   What?
   What's Poshul's
   favorite dish?
   I can't tell you that!
   It's a secret between
   us ladies!

   Fine!
   
Poshul:
   Oh, hi Serge..
   Me am a bit busy
   right now.
   Have you already
   met up with Leena?
   Me think she wath
   by the pier.

Poshul:
   Me am a bit busy
   right now.
   Maybe next time.
   
Poshul:
   Yeth? What ith it?
   ...[Item]?
   Me told you, Serge..
   Me am very busy
   right now.
 
 [Girl]
   It's boring playing alone.
   Come on, Poshul,
   let's play!

Poshul:
   Me am thorry.
   Me am a bit busy
   right now.
   We'll play
   later, OK?

 [Girl]
   How boring!
 
 [Old Woman]
   I did everything just as
   Chief Radius told me.
   And now, the aches in my
   body are completely gone!
   What a fine man our chief is.
   Skilled, competent, caring...
   I heard he was quite a
   warrior in his prime.
   You could learn much
   from our chief and
   grow up to be a great
   man like Radius.
 
 [Old Woman]
   A Komodo dragon scale?
   It's pathetic how boys are
   chasing around girls
   with that thing...
   Instead, why not boil Chief
   Radius's toe cheese and
   drink it? It'll grow some
   hair on your chest!
 
 [Man]
   The Record of Fate tells
   me not to go out to sea today.
   That's why I'm here for
   the chief's lecture.
   Go against the Record
   of Fate and you'll
   regret it for sure.
   Days like this, it's
   best to take it easy!
   We should all live
   in harmony with fate.
   
   Is that a Komodo
   dragon scale?
   It's really popular among
   girls these days, isn't it?
   It means nothing to me, though.
   The Record of Fate makes
   no mention of it.
 
 [Gonji]
   Hi, Serge.
   I, Gonji, know all and see all!
   I can tell you all you need
   to know about using Key Items!

   How about it?
   ~~~Tell me, Gonji
   ~~~No, thanks

   Good, good!
   I'd be happy to.
   Listen carefully, now.
   When you want to give someone
   a Key Item, get within talking
   distance and press the Bouton002.
   This will bring up the item menu.
   Then, select the item you
   wish to give and confirm.
   If all goes well, the person
   should respond.
   It's the same procedure for
   when you want to use a Key Item
   at a specific location.
   Just select the item you wish to use.
   No need to worry about
   making mistakes.
   The item won't disappear
   if there's no response.
   Well, that's about it.
   Come to me anytime should
   you have any questions, boy.
   Hwa-fah-fah-fah-fah!

   Hmmm...? You already
   know how to use Key Items?
   Darn... I have to think of
   something new for next time...
 
 [Gonji]
   Yes, yes, exactly!
   That's how it's done.
   Looks like I taught
   you well, boy.
   But, Serge,
   I have absolutely no use
   for that [Item]!
   Hwa-fah-fah-fah-fah!

   Oh, so you already know
   how to use Key Items.
   But, Serge,
   I have absolutely no use
   for that [Item]!
   Hwa-fah-fah-fah-fah!
   
 [Chief's Hut, Arni (Home)]

   Cure behind the frame!
 
 [Young Woman]
   Time sure does fly.
   Chief Radius has been
   living here for 4 years
   already.
   He is such a bright,
   cheerful man.
   Everyone in the village
   really likes him...
   I wish he could stay
   here forever...
 
 [Old Man]
   Oh, it's you, Serge.
   I think the chief
   is outside.
   He said he was going to
   teach some self-defense...
   He may be old, but he still
   has some fight left in him.
   You kids better not
   misbehave, or else the
   chief will have to
   crack down on you all.

 [Old Man]
   It says,
   ~~'"The ecstasy and anxiety
   ~~  of the chosen one..."'
   A mega-babe is in
   love with me, WHEEEE!
   I'm on cloud nine!!!
   But I don't wanna get dumped!
   It tells of how naive the
   hearts of man are.
   Only Chief Radius can come up
   with a golden saying like that!
 
 [Woman]
   If you want to record what
   you've done so far, step
   up to the Record of Fate
   and open up the Menu.
   Then select the block
   you want and follow the
   directions to save.
   Easy, isn't it?
   But you should go look
   for another one.
   I'm going to be here
   for a while.
   Oh yeah, and if you go
   out onto the World Map,
   you can save without
   the Record of Fate.
 
 [Woman]
   No cutting in
   line, Serge!
   Back of the line!
 
 [Man]
   That's exactly right, Serge.
   There it is...
   The Record of Fate.
   It records everything, good or bad.
   If you see one of those
   things outside, don't forget
   to record everything you've
   done so far.
   Think of how terrible it
   would be if you lost your past.
   There wouldn't be anything
   you could do about it.
 
 [Man]
   C'mon, Serge...
   Stop gettin'
   in my face.
  
 [Girl]
   If you listen closely,
   the Record of Fate will
   tell you lots of things.
   Like what you should be doing next.
   And when you can't hear
   anything anymore...
   Well... I guess it means
   you don't have a future...
   When that happens, you should
   just go home and go to sleep.
   There isn't anything you can
   do to change fate.
 
 [Girl]
   Serge!!!
   Keep your hands
   to yourself, PU-LEASE!!!
   
 [Eatery, Arni (Home)]
 
 [Old Man]
   Humina, humina, humina...!
   She sure is pretty!
   What a knockout that
   dancer Miki is!
   The port town of Termina
   has its share of dancers,
   but no one, I say, NO ONE
   compares to Miki.
   But mind you, I've never
   actually seen Miki
   dance...
   Oh...how I would love
   to see them jiggle...
   Err, I'm talking about
   her arms, of course.
   
   Whoa...! Serge!
   Don't tell
   grandma about this!
   
 [Young Man]
   Yo, Serge.
   Have you heard anything
   about them group of thieves
   up on the mainland?

   I think...
   ~~~I've heard this story
   ~~~I haven't

   Yeah, I guess
   they're big
   news nowadays.
   I think they call themselves
   the Radical Dreamers.
   Bunch of show-offs.
   They're no different
   from psycho killers.
   So many freaks out in
   the world these days...
   I guess it's just a
   sign of the times.

   You really haven't been
   keeping up, have you?
   It's pretty big news,
   even in El Nido.
   Those mysterious thieves
   have broken into a bunch
   of houses up on the mainland.
   They're cold-blooded
   bastards.
   They'll go to any extreme
   to get money or jewels.
   Even the powerful nation
   of Porre can't seem to
   get a hold of them.
   I think they call themselves
   the Radical Dreamers...
   Wouldn't want to run into
   those bandits...

 [Poet Girl]
   Why, hello, Serge.
   Do you want to hear
   the real truth about
   the world?
   
   Insanity leads to chaos,
   Then to solitude...
   The fruitless effort of adding
   Meaning to what is meaningless
   A lone, crimson tear
   Falls to the sea...
   The echo of the remaining star
   Cries out in the infinite vacuum
   The least I can do
   Is send my distant prayers
   Over the wind of time,
   Setting sail on dreams...
 
   ...Well?
   How'd you like it, Serge?
   Were you moved?
   I've been dreaming about
   becoming a poet since
   I was little.
   I want to cross the continent
   and make a name for myself
   with just a pencil and paper...
   
   But look at me...
   I'm in this puny village
   in the middle of nowhere,
   waitressing in this run-down shack.

 [Belcha]
   WhatCHA say about
   my restaurant!?
   You can quit
   anytime, you know.
   
 [Poet Girl]
   Just kidding...!
   I was just kidding!
   I was just saying how good
   the work environment is.

   Hm? You want to hear
   my poem again, Serge?
   
   ~~~Uhh... No, thanks...
 
 [Poet Girl]
   Sigh...
   So you don't want
   to hear it, huh...?

   I guess I'm just another
   one of those unappreciated
   geniuses...
   
   Really!?
   Thank you,
   Serge!
   That means you really
   like my poem!
   I'll make you the honorary
   president of my fan club!

   Ahem...
   OK, ready?
   
   Well, Serge?
   Were you moved to tears?
   Could you feel your heart melting?
   Do you think I can make it?

   Oh, how I would love to cross
   the continent and take a
   gamble on my dream and talent.
   Waitressing in this run-dow...
   
 [Belcha]
   .........
   You're fired.
 
 [Poet Girl]
   Yikes!
   
   I said I was kidding!
   It was just a joke!
   You should really
   lighten up a bit.
 
 [Belcha]
   ......
   ............

 [Poet Girl]
   
   
 [Poet Girl]
   What is that?
   A Komodo dragon scale?
   So it's fashionable to make
   necklaces out of those?

   I'm sorry, Serge.
   I'm really not into
   materialistic things.
   I'm always searching for
   the truth...030
   Drifting endlessly, alone
   Through darkened seas...
   
 [Belcha]
   Yo, Serge.
   Have you heard your message
   of the day from the
   '"Record of Fate?"'
   It's a green pyramid
   which records your daily
   activities for you.
   It's been said that this
   pyramid can not only record
   the past, but also tell
   about the future.
   But, I really don't
   know if that's
   true or not.
   CHA-HA-HA-HA!
   
 [Belcha]
   That's my specialty!
   Soup made exclusively
   from Heckran bones.
   Don't mean to brag,
   but nobody can make
   soup like I can!
   CHA-HA-HA-HA!
 
   CHA! CHA!
   There ain't no way
   I'm tellin' ya the secret
   to my Heckran soup!
   My bro taught me how to
   make this special soup.
   There ain't no way I'm
   givin' out this recipe.

   CHA! CHA!
   There ain't no way
   I'm tellin' ya the secret
   to my Heckran soup!
   Only the Record of Fate
   and I know that I've
   hidden the Heckran
   bone up in my room.

   Yeowwwww!

 [Belcha]
   My wife will kill
   me if she finds me
   snackin' like this.
 

   [Member] found
   Heckran Bone!

   It's empty...

   Membre found
   Ivory Helmet!
   
 [Belcha]
   Yowzer!
   You found my
   Heckran bone!
   Oh, what the heck...
   I'll give it to you.
   But I ain't gonna teachCHA
   how to make the soup!
   My bro will kill me
   if I give out the
   secret recipe.
   
   It's just a '"barrel"'...
 
 [Barrel]
   Whaddaya want, already!?
   I said I'm just a '"barrel!"'
   Tch... Fine!
   Just take it, man!
   HERE!

   Uplift
   in the barrel.

   But it's just a '"barrel"'...

 [Old Man]
   Hello there, Serge.
   Word has it that Komodo dragon
   scales are quite popular among
   the young 'uns these days.
   So you're collecting them
   too, huh? What, to make
   a silly little necklace?
 
   ~~~That's right!
   ~~~No way!
 
   HeeeHeeeHeee!
   Well said, Serge!!!
   You truly are a man of the sea!
   They don't call me the
   '"Komodo Dragon Expert"'
   for nothing.
   Let me give you some pointers.
   Clean out your ears and
   listen well, Serge.
   This is truly top secret.
 
   My Super-duper Secret #1
   ~~~Rock n' roll to
   ~~~trap the sucker!
 
   My Super-duper Secret #2
   ~~~Use the lay of the land
   ~~~and make a surprise attack!
 
   My Super-duper Secret #3
   ~~~There is always one that
   ~~~likes to play tag!
   ~~~Run with all your might!
 
   Beware, these dragons are mighty
   cautious and run at high speeds.
   You must face them with your
   wits, courage, and tenacity.
   Use your lightning start
   and run like the wind!
   Whip past it with
   all your might!!!
   But I guess there's no
   point outrunning it...
   Anyhow, it's all about
   guts, my boy!
   So once you catch up
   to it, you must fight.
   Kick that little
   sucker's butt!
 
   But don't get your
   own butt kicked!
   Hehehehe...
 
   That's about all
   I can teach you about
   the ways of an expert.
   Now go, Serge!
   Go for the gold and bring
   forth a brighter tomorrow!!!
   
   Hehehe... Sorry...
 
   Oh, then forget it.
   You're no fun...
   Listen Serge, you have
   to live a little.
   Some words of advice...
   Mega-babe chicks, rock-me-
   to-the-bone music, and
   slap-me-silly beverages!
  
 [Old Man]
   What? You want to
   hear my super-duper
   secrets again?

   ~~~Thankfully, no
   ~~~Unfortunately, yes
   
   You don't have to
   hold back, you know...
   I'm sure you'll be able to
   succeed me as a
   Komodo Dragon Expert!
   Devotion is the key, Serge.

   Hmmm...
   Actually, I really don't
   have time to be going
   over this with you...
   But I guess it is my duty
   as a Komodo Dragon Expert.
   Perhaps it's destiny.

   Clean out your ears
   even deeper, Serge,
   and listen carefully.
   
   So, Serge...
   How'd it go?
   Did my pointers help?
   What...?
   Someone gave it to you!?

   You lily-livered coward!!!
   A true man uses wits, courage,
   and tenacity to catch one!
   
   Think about it, Serge.
   What good is something
   if you didn't work
   your heart out for it?

   I guess
   I overestimated you...
   
 [Kiki]
   Isn't my Celine cute!?
   Daddy found her by
   Lizard Rock.
   A lot of baby Komodo
   dragons play out there.
   I guess it's kinda
   like their hangout.

   And you know what, Sergey?
   Don't tell anyone what
   I'm about to tell you, OK...?
   It's a secret...

   Lolo said he was going
   to get me some Komodo
   dragon scales!
   Heeeeee! What should I do!?
   
   Hey, Sergey!
   Is that really a...
   Komodo dragon scale!?

   You're making me blush, Sergey!
   I can't accept it.
   I have Lolo...

   But thanks anyway,
   Sergey!
 
 [Kiki]
   Sergey!
   Don't be mean
   to my Celine!
  
 [Kiki's Mom]
   Do you know about
   Lizard Rock, southwest
   of the village?
   I've heard that a mother Komodo
   dragon comes out every once in a while.
   I've told Kiki numerous times
   not to play there, but...
   She never listens to me.
   I guess kids will be kids.
   
   That Kiki!
   I wonder if that child
   knows how worried I get.
   That goes for you too, Serge.
   You shouldn't be playing out there.
   It's dangerous.
   
   Oh, Serge?
   A Komodo dragon scale
   for me...?
   
   I can't!
   I'm married!
   
   But thanks anyway!
   You should give that
   to a girlfriend.
 
 [Kiki's Dad]
   Oh... Ah...
   Hi Serge...
   I was lost in my thoughts there.

   You know how Kiki's
   growing up so quickly?
   Sometimes, I'm just amazed at how
   much she resembles her mother.
   Yeah... I guess my wife
   is like that, too. She's been
   very much like her mother since
   as long as I can remember...
   I guess that demonstrates
   how life continues to live
   on through generations.

   It's been about 10 years since
   I became a fisherman. Back then,
   I still had other aspirations,
   but I ended up succeeding my dad.
   I guess you can say,
   everything here represents
   10 years of my life.
   Lion sharks, sawfish, 6-horned
   narwhales, you name it...
   They represent all my hard work
   and dedication.

   I love my job, and I'm happy with
   my current lifestyle and all...
   but lately, I get to thinking
   when I see Kiki...
   About how I could've had
   a different future...
   If I had chosen a different
   path 10 years ago...
   Then I'd be living a
   completely different
   life than I am now.
   I'm not saying which one
   would've been better...
   But I just wonder where the
   other path may have led me...
   I guess the longer you live,
   the more you wonder about
   another '"you"' that
   might have been.

   Boy...
   Life sure is complex...

   OH! Hey, Serge,
   you want this?
   Here, take it.
   It's an amulet I made from
   a lion shark tooth 10 years
   ago, when I decided to
   become a fisherman!
   I don't need it anymore.
   I have my wife and Kiki
   watching over me.

   [Member] received
   Shark Tooth!
   
 [Kiki's Dad]
   I just get this feeling
   that there's another me
   living another life...
   It's just a funny
   feeling I have.
   Sounds crazy, huh?

   But, if for any reason
   you happen to meet him...
   I want you to give
   him that amulet.
   And tell him, '"it's
   from the other you!"'

   Alright then!
   Off to catch some more
   fish! I need to buy Kiki
   a new dress, you know.
   
   It's an amulet I made from a
   lion shark tooth 10 years ago...
   Back when I decided to become
   a fisherman.
   For the past 10 years, I've
   endured some hardships, but
   that kept me going.
   Can't disappoint my old self.
   But I don't need it anymore.
   I have my wife and my
   daughter Kiki.

 [Leena's Grandma]
   Good morning,
   Serge.
   Don't tell me you
   just woke up!?
   Don't you know that the
   early bird gets the worm?
   Leena's over there
   on the pier.
   Looks like her mother
   asked her to baby-sit.
   
   You'll find Leena on the pier.
   You can see her from here.
   Better hurry on over now.
   Take my advice, Serge.
   Don't make girls angry.
   You'll be lucky to get away with
   only a broken neck, hwa-hwa-hwa...!

   You used to cry and run away
   at the mere sight of a pussycat.
   Do you remember...?
   When you were about wee high, you
   were attacked by a panther demon.
   I guess it left an emotional scar.
   But it's good that you've
   overcome that fear.
   Girls will think you're a
   weenie, running away from cats!
   
   A grandmother like
   me has no use for
   such things.
   Why not seduce a cute
   lady your own age with it?
   Hwa-hwa-hwa...!

   But if you do anything
   to hurt Leena's feelings,
   I'll really give it to you,
   young man!

   when our investigation

 [Porre Soldier]
   Beat it, kid.
   There's nothing
   to see here.

 [Hydra Marshes (Home)]
   
 [Man]
   Why, if it isn't
   Serge!
   Didn't the village
   elders tell you not
   to come near here!

   Keep out!!!

   There's some writing

 [Acacia Dragoon]
   The Acacia Dragoons are
   currently investigating
   the area. It is off-limits
   to the general public.
   We will inform you

 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Beat it, kid.
   There's nothing

 [Divine Dragon Falls (Another)]
 
 [Demi-human Man]
   Years ago, these falls were
   considered a holy place
   by the worshipers of the
   Divine Dragon Faith.
   Then hordes of humans began
   to migrate to these islands
   and we were pushed into
   the outlying regions.
   In the cultural takeover
   that ensued, the spiritual
   significance of places such
   as this was soon forgotten.
 
 [Demi-human Woman]
   In the old days, many of
   my friends and fellow
   believers would come
   here to worship.
   It was quite lively,
   particularly during the
   festival seasons.
   How I miss those days...
   
 [Explorer]
   We can't let you in
   until our expedition
   is complete!
 
 [Explorer]
   Hey, Caaptaaiin!
   Found anything yet?
   
 [Explorer]
   Finders, keepers...
   We were here first!
   
 [Hydra Marshes (Another)]
 
 [Explorer]
   Several years ago, when all
   the Hydra died off, this
   woodland became covered with
   a thick fog, and the waters
   became polluted and acidic.
   But the real cause was us
   humans killing off the flora
   and fauna. I just hope we
   don't come to regret the
   destruction we caused!
   
   Hey... If you're thinking of
   heading into the deeper parts
   of these marshes, let me give
   you a piece of advice...
   The marsh-waters have
   varying degrees of acidity.
   It's not enough to cause long
   term effects, but...
   If you don't wear safety gear,
   it will slowly deplete your
   health and weaken you.
   So take care now!
   
 [Explorer]
   What are you walking
   around these marshes in
   such light clothing for?
   Sigh... Damned amateur!
   Don't expect me to save you
   when you die from the acid!

 [Explorer]
   What are you guys doing walking
   around these marshes in
   such light clothing?
   Sigh... Damned amateurs!
   Don't expect me to save you
   when you die of poisoning!

   My fellow expedition crew
   members up on the tree top
   have spare safety gear they
   can lend you. Go ask them!
   
 [Explorer]
   If you want to go deeper into
   the forest, you need the
   proper equipment and the means
   to control those strange plants.

   Unlike the plants by the entrance,
   these plants seem to have been
   completely mutated by the toxin. They'll
   whack you in the face if you touch them.
   I've heard that the dwarves who
   used to inhabit this forest used
   to be able to bend these plants
   without touching them.
   
   Hey... You're not
   looking so good!
   Don't tell me you
   got poisoned!?
   You know that the
   monsters in these marshes
   often use poison to attack
   their foes, don't you?
   If you're going to walk in
   these woods, you should
   at least carry some
   Antidotes with you!
   Here, I'll use some of my
   Elements on you this time.
   But be careful next time...
   Come! Step over here...

   There. Now that's better!
   I've cured your poison
   problem, but haven't
   healed your damage.
   You should at least do
   that much for yourself.
   Elements aren't cheap,
   you know!?

Captain:
   Hey, hey, hey...
   You gotta be crazy to walk around
   this forest without protective gear.
   I have an extra set with me. Take 'em.
   This way, you'll be able to walk through
   the marsh without getting hurt.

Captain:
   Hey, hey, hey...
   You gotta be crazy to walk around
   this forest without protective gear.
   I have an extra set with me. Take 'em.
   This way, you'll be able to walk through
   the marsh without getting hurt.
   
   Safety Gear!

Captain:
   Oh, and watch out for the monsters
   lurking deep within the forest.
   We haven't actually explored
   those parts, yet.
   We don't know how to get there.
   
Captain:
   It's like a dream come true,
   being able to work this closely
   with the wonders of the world!
   By the way, have you heard of a
   remote island called '"Gaea's Navel?"'
   ~~~No, I haven't
   ~~~I've heard of it

Captain:
   It's a remote island completely
   enclosed by bluffs, located to
   the south of El Nido Archipelago.
   Legend has it, there's a '"Primeval
   Forest"' still unexplored to this day.
   Makes me tingle with excitement!

Captain:
   Legend has it, there's an
   unexplored '"Primeval Forest"'.
   I hope to make it there
   on my own one of these days.
   I want to explore all the
   mysteries of this planet.
 
 [Explorer]
   With that safety gear on,
   the toxic marsh-waters
   will be no problem!
   But remember there are
   also a lot of monsters
   here, so don't do
   anything stupid now!
   
   is too slippery to climb!
 
 [Arni (Another)]
 
 [Old Man]
   Well now, you're in Arni.
   What brings you here to
   this quiet, seaside village?
   There isn't much excitement
   here, but please relax
   and stay awhile.

   Are you new to this region?
   Then I'd advise you to stay
   away from Hydra Marshes.
   Ever since the Hydra
   was wiped out several
   years ago, the water
   over there's gone bad.
   I hear the water's
   actually poisoned.
   Better not set foot
   in there, young man.
 
   Rainbow Shell!
   
 [Woman]
   I'm sorry, but that's
   not for sale.
   Can I interest you
   in something else?
   
   I said...
   It's not for sale!
   Why don't you just
   buy something else?
   
 [Woman]
   Hello!
   Can I interest
   you in something?
   I have some
   great Elements.
   Would you like
   to take a look?

   ~~~No, thank you
   ~~~Show me your Elements
   ~~~Show me your Weapons/Armor 

   Oh... Oh well...
   Come again some time.

   Sure!
   Just one second...

   Thanks.
   Come again.
   
   Oh my!
   A dragon scale?
   Sorry.
   You can't coax me into
   giving you a discount
   with that.
   
 [Woman]
   Hello!
   How can I help you?
   
Una:
   Oh, hi.
   Are you new here?
   Leena?
   I think she's on the
   pier, baby-sittin'.
   She should be on
   the pier.
   Are you a friend
   of Leena's?
   
Una:
   Yeah, my sister
   still needs to
   work on her temper...
   She has those temper
   tantrums, you know...
   You get a slap in the
   face before she even
   opens her mouth.
   I'm sure if she gets
   herself a boyfriend,
   she'll act a little
   more ladylike...
   
 [Old Woman]
   The pier's up ahead.
   Listen, don't be doin'
   any mischief to them boats.
   A boat is like a limb
   to our fisherman.
   But I guess outsiders
   like you wouldn't
   understand.
   
   What is that?
   What do you plan to do
   with a monster scale?
 
 [Old Man]
   Looks like it's gonna be
   another scorcher today.
   It hasn't rained in
   quite a while...
   I don't know how much
   longer us old-timers
   can stand this heat...
 
 [Old Man (Sometimes they're switched)]
   By the way...
   I wonder if the Termina
   knights are still
   digging that hole?
   I suppose they're
   conducting some
   kind of investigation...
   In any case, I'm
   sure General Viper
   has a good reason.
   
 [Old Woman]
   By the way...
   I wonder if those knights
   are still digging that hole?
   I don't know what those
   Termina knights are up to.
   I hear they're digging up
   Fossil Valley...
   I'm sure General Viper
   has a good reason.
   But why would they want to
   dig up a place like that?
   
   A dragon scale?
   Don't try to scare me
   with that, young man.
   Who in their right mind
   would want the body part
   of a monster?
 
 [Boy]
   Have you heard anything about
   the El Nido Triangle down south?
   Everyone says it's really
   creepy over there.
   Some say you can hear
   strange voices.
   Some even claim to have seen
   a huge, glowing egg down below!
   I tell ya, adults are
   so superstitious!
   They try to act all tough, but
   this kinda stuff scares them.
 
 [Man]
   Arghhhh!
   I just haven't been able
   to hit a big one lately,
   you know?
   I'm not really concerned
   about the money or profit.
   I just have this urge
   for a challenge...
   C'mon, baby!
   I know you're out there!
   I need some excitement!
   Give me a big catch!
   
   Hey, that's an amulet made
   from a lion shark tooth.
   It's huge!
   There's no doubt:
   that lion shark must've
   been a monster!
   Don't tell me you're
   the one that caught it?
   Only a first-class man of
   the sea can catch
   one that big!
   
 [Boy]
   Hey, hey, stranger?
   Do you know what's popular
   among the village girls
   these days?
   A bracelet made
   from a rainbow shell.
   I want to get some for
   Kiki, but those shells
   are so hard to find...
   Ohhh nooo!
   If I don't do something
   about this now, Kiki
   might start liking Lolo!

   Boy...
   Am I in a fix...
   
   Is that...
   a Komodo dragon scale?
   Yeah...right... Like
   any girl would want that!
   You don't get it, do you?
   
 [Boy]
   Whatchoo got there...?
   [Item]...?
   That's not what I want!
   Don't get my hopes up
   like that, stranger.
   That [Item] isn't
   the key to her heart.

 [Boy]
   A rainbow shell...
   You have to be super
   lucky to find one...
   If I don't do something
   about this, Kiki will
   fall for Lolo for sure!
   Oh...boy...!
   What am I gonna do!?
 
 [Chief's Hut, Arni (Another)]
 
 [Young Woman]
   Just between you and me,
   our chief, Gonji, is really stingy.
   I can't cook a decent
   meal if I don't have
   fresh, quality ingredients!
   And then he complains about
   how terrible the food tastes...
   I can't stand it!
   
 [Young Woman]
   Every time I come to a decision,
   I always wonder what would
   have happened if I had decided
   the other way.
   Maybe I should have done
   this instead of that...
   Maybe I made the wrong
   decision...
   But luckily, we have the
   Record of Fate.
   It tells us exactly what
   choices to make.
   I can't imagine life
   without it.
   Everyday would be filled
   with anxiety and fear.
   
 [Young Woman]
   No cutting in line!
   Back of the line!
   
 [Girl]
   The only things the
   Record of Fate doesn't
   touch upon are life and death.
   I don't mind, really...
   I don't think I really
   want to know.
   More importantly,
   what should I see first at
   the festival in Termina?
   Should I go catch
   Nikki's concert?
   The mermaid dance show?
   Hmmm...
   What to see...
   
 [Girl]
   EXCUSE YOU!
   Stop pushing, and
   keep your hands to yourself!
 
 [Old Man]
   That's right.
   The Record of Fate records
   everything for us, good or bad.
   So when the time comes for
   us to bid adieu, our life
   story will live on in
   the Record of Fate.
   Think about how terrible
   it would be if you left this
   world with no record of your
   very existence.
   
 [Old Man]
   Hey man,
   stop gettin'
   in my face.
   
   Tablet behind the frame!
   
 [Young Man]
   Yes?
   You want to see
   the chief?
   Huh? Radius?
   Who's that?
   Gonji is our chief.
   There's no one by
   that name here.
   You must be mistaken.
   
 [Young Man]
   You're a strange one.
   What are you starin'
   at the wall for?
   It's just your everyday wall.
   Our chief doesn't like
   hanging stuff from it.
 
 [Gonji]
   You're a new face
   around here...
   We don't get too
   many visitors.
   My name's Gonji.
   I'm the chief of Arni.
   Why don't you stay
   and rest awhile?
   Can't offer any extravagant
   entertainment, but make
   yourself at home.
   
 [Cafe Fleur, Arni (Another)]
 
 [Old Woman]
   Humina, humina, humina...!
   What a hunk!
   This here is Nikki from
   the Magical Dreamers!
   As luck would have it,
   Nikki is holding a concert
   in the port town of Termina!
   There is a heaven on earth!
   It pays to live to an old age.
   I can't believe I'm actually
   going to be able to hear
   Nikki's beautiful voice!

   Whoa, stranger!
   Don't tell
   gramps about this!
 
 [Old Man]
   This year's Viper Festival
   is going to be some event!
   They're going to have a famous
   minstrel band there.
   You see that poster over there?
   He's the lead guitarist and
   vocalist of the band.
   He dresses flamboyantly,
   but he drives the women mad,
   young and old!
   He puts on a powerful show, too.
 
 [Young Man]
   Yo, stranger.
   Have you heard anything
   about them group of thieves
   up on the mainland?

   Thieves...?
   ~~~Yes, I have
   ~~~No, I haven't

   Yeah, I guess news travels fast.
   Even down here on the islands.
   I think they call themselves
   the Radical Dreamers.
   Bunch of show-offs.
   They're no different
   from psycho killers.
   So many freaks out in
   the world these days...
   I guess it's just a
   sign of the times.

   You haven't heard, eh?
   Where are you from, stranger?
   It's pretty big news, even
   down here in El Nido.
   Those mysterious thieves
   have broken into a bunch of
   houses up on the mainland.
   They're cold-blooded
   bastards.
   They'll go to any extreme
   to get money or jewels.
   Even the powerful nation
   of Porre can't seem to
   get a hold of them.
   I think they call themselves
   the Radical Dreamers...
   Wouldn't want to run into
   those bandits...
   
 [Belcha's Wife]
   Hello, young man.
   What can I do for you?
   Hm? What happened to the
   cook that speaks funny,
   you ask?
   Oh, you mean my lesser half:
   my husband.
   He went on a journey to
   brush up on his cooking.
   I have no idea where
   he could be...
 
   Are you a friend of
   my husband?
   He is so unenthusiastic
   about his cooking...
   I wantCHA to tell him
   to come back already
   if you see him.
   Hehehe...
   
 [Poet Girl]
   Hi there.
   Haven't seen you
   around before.
   Are you from Termina?
   So how's it going over there?
   I bet everyone's
   really excited about
   the Viper Festival!
   
   What...? My poems?
   What are you talking about?
   I gave up on them ages ago!
   It was just a stupid dream
   I was obsessed with.
   I never did have any talent...
   
   But...
   How do you know
   about that?
   Nobody knows about my poetry...
   
   It really doesn't matter
   anymore whether I'm
   writing poems or not...
   Nobody would give a hoot
   about someone writing poems
   in a tiny little cafe
   in the middle of nowhere...
   
 [Belcha's Wife]
   Oh, a tiny little cafe
   in the middle of nowhere, huh?
   But just remember, dreams
   do come true.
   
 [Poet Girl]
   Hmph!
   
   Do you honestly
   believe that?
   We live in the middle
   of nowhere, in this
   tiny village, leading
   small lives...
   Nothing's ever going to change,
   no matter how hard you try.030
   That's just the reality
   of it all...
   
 [Belcha's Wife]
   ......
   Sigh...
   
 [Poet Girl]
   What!?
   I don't want to talk
   about the poems.
   Leave me alone!
   
   It seems to be just a '"pot"'...

 [Pot]
   Whaddaya want already!?
   I said I'm just a '"pot!"'
   Tch... Fine!
   Just take it, man!
   HERE!
 
   Ice Lance
   inside the pot.

   No answer...
   It's just a '"pot"'...
   
 [Kiki's House, Arni (Another)]
   
 [Kiki's Grandpa]
   I can't comprehend
   my son anymore.
   He hasn't worked in years.
   There was a time when
   he had his heart set on
   becoming a man of the sea,
   just like his old man...
   But look at him now...
   Praying to that silly
   lookin' doll day and night.
   What has gotten into him...?
   
   Well, well, well...!
   If it isn't a Komodo
   dragon scale!
   Getting a hold of one of
   these proves you've
   become a real man!
   My son used to gather
   up a ton of these. But that
   was back in the old days...
   
   My...what do we have here...?
   An amulet made from a
   lion shark tooth!?
   That lion shark must've
   been huge!
   Don't tell me you're
   the one that caught it, boy?

   Had my son become a man of
   the sea, he would have
   had no problem tackling a
   lion shark of this size...
   But look at him now...
   Just wasting his life away..
   Where did he go wrong?
   I didn't raise him that way.
   
 [Kiki's Mom]
   10 years ago, my husband's
   friend lost a son...
   The boy drowned at sea
   at the tender age of 7...
   And soon after, the boy's
   parents passed away, too.
   Such a sad turn of events...
   That's when my husband changed.
   Never did I imagine he
   would end up like this...
   His way of life has changed
   completely.

   People sure change...
   Swayed by time,
   an unforeseen turn of events...
   It's really disheartening,
   but there's nothing we can do.
   No one can change or defy
   time or fate...
   
   Back when we were young, my
   husband would talk about
   how he would take a shark
   tooth amulet out to sea and...
   ...I really don't know what to
   believe or how to go on...
   Especially when you realize life
   doesn't turn out like you expect.
   
 [Kiki]
   ......
   Daddy always spends
   his time downstairs...
   He won't play with me...
   And he gets real mad
   if I go down there, too...
   He didn't used
   to be like that...
   I bet he doesn't
   like me anymore...

   What is that?
   A Komodo dragon scale!?
   Ewww! That's disgusting!
   GO AWAY!

   Wow! Is that amulet
   made from a real
   lion shark tooth?
   My daddy once told me
   real men of the sea
   take one of those amulets
   out to sea for good luck.
   I wonder if daddy
   will ever be his
   old self again?
 
   from Lasery the cat!!!
   ......NOT!
   
   You felt an aura of longevity
   from Aurey the cat!!!
   ......NOT!
   
   You received a sacred
   lickaroo from Lickey the cat!!!
   ......NOT!
   
   No answer...
   It seems to be just a
   straw doll...
   
 [Kiki's Dad]
   Oh, hello there.
   I just finished praying.

   Here, take a look.
   It's called Mojo.
   It's a good luck charm
   from the Far East.

   Can you feel the love and
   affection oozing from it!?
   It's just such an amazing
   messenger of love and courage!!!

   Think about it, my brother.
   How our everyday lives are
   controlled by uncertainty
   and fear...
   Our spent yesterdays,
   and an uncertain tomorrow...
   How we live a
   meaningless today...
   This holy item, filled with
   the prayers of people today,
   protects us and supports us.

   Come, my brother.
   Let us pray together and
   bring piece of mind
   to our hearts!

   Where you can find true love
   and piece of mind...?
   Within Mojo!!!
   
   Let us pray together,
   my brother!

   Where you can find true love
   and piece of mind...?
   Within Mojo!!!
   
 [Kiki's Dad]
   This is a tooth from a
   ferocious lion shark!
   And look at the size
   of this thing!
   Judging from the size,
   this baby must have
   been a good 15 feet!

   Don't tell me you're
   the one who caught it...?

   WHAT!?
   What did you say!?
   Another me...!?
   So, the '"other me,"' who
   became a fisherman,
   asked you to give
   this to me...?

   What are you talking about!?
   That's enough!
   There is only one ME! How can
   there be another ME out there!?

   ......
   Sure, there was a point in
   my life when I thought about
   becoming a fisherman...
   That was a good 10 years ago...
   But I couldn't do it...
   I gave up that path
   right then and there.
   I just gave up...

   I don't care what
   you say.
   This is the path I chose,
   and I don't regret it...
   Besides, you can't just
   change the way you live
   in the blink of an eye.
   Now if you would
   please put that thing
   away and leave me alone!
   
   I have nothing more
   to say.
   Now, please leave!
   
   ......

 [Leena's House, Arni (Another)]
 
 [Leena's Grandma]
   Greetings, sonny.
   You're a new face
   in this village.
   A friend of Leena, perhaps?
   You'll find Leena
   out there on the pier,
   baby-sitting.
   
   Hmmm......
   I have this funny feeling
   I've met you somewhere
   before, sonny...
   Very...strange...
   Perhaps my memory is finally
   catching up with my age...
   
   ......?
   What is that?
   A Komodo scale?
   What parts are
   you from, sonny?
   No one on this island
   would want anything like that.
   And I'm sure all the girls
   will be disgusted by
   such a thing.
   
   That reminds me...
   The boy who lived next
   door was terrified of cats.
   But that was more than 10 years ago.
   That boy was attacked by
   a panther demon when he was
   very young. I guess it left
   an emotional scar.
   Poor, poor boy...
   No one ever imagined such
   a tragedy would take place
   several years later...

   Are you the exorcists?
   You're younger than
   I expected.
   Anyway, do you hear that

   All we want you to do
   is to stop that noise.
   I don't believe in

   what you have to do.

   Why must we conduct such
   strange investigations...?
   I just hope it's not
   some kind of omen...

   Skulls are not supposed

   Just send your invoice
   to Viper Manor.
   Thank you.

   There might be a

   It's only my first day
   on the job!
   
   !!! HEY!
   Don't go down there!
   I'm the one that's gonna
   get it from the boss if I
   let anyone down there!
   Plus, I really think there's
   a monster down below!

   Listen...uhh...
   Can we make it so that it was

   Come on, please?

 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Wow! That was quick.
   I'm glad we called in
   professionals to get
   the job done.
   Actually, there was a
   man claiming to be a
   priest who came by earlier.
   Of course, I sent him back.
   He was certainly a fake.

   Huh?
   Who was that?
   You don't know who he is?
   Ahaa, you must be one of
   the tourists here to 
   see the festival.
   That boy is dear, sweet Glenn,
   a member of the Acacia Dragoons.
   Pretty popular with the people here.
   But it really surprises me
   to see that naughty little
   boy grown so mature...
   It makes me feel my age. Sigh...
   
   Ah, it's a bellflower, isn't it?
   It's a pretty flower, but it has
   a slightly lonesome feel.
   Dario loved this flower.
   He kept his own sadness and
   sufferings to himself, so I
   kind of understand why he
   liked that flower...

   But where did you get
   that flower?
   Dear Glenn will be
   delighted if you bring
   that to him.

   Flowers decorate the

   Don't you think it's
   romantic to have the
   whole town filled with
   flowers?
   It's our way of showing
   our gratitude towards
   Master Viper.
   We are really thankful

   Oh, you silly boy.

   Well, well. So this is that
   singer Nikki everyone's been
   talking about. My dear, he
   looks like a girl...
   When I was a young girl, it was
   a luxury for even a girl to have
   any makeup on. Nowadays, even
   the boys are becoming glamorous.
   As long as it's trendy, I might
   as well join in with the youngsters
   and show off my go-go dancing!
   Hyahyahya!

   When the weather is so nice out,
   the laundry will dry quickly.
   It makes me so happy, and the laundry
   even has a fresh, sun-dried scent too.
   Then again, if it gets too dry,
   I'll start worrying about droughts...
   Sometimes, it's got to rain too.
   Am I being a bit too selfish?
   
 [Demi-human Man]
   Me like working.
   But work all day, tiring.
   Need rest.
   When me rest, overseer mad.
   Me have hard time.
   
 [Overseer]
   What are you looking
   at? I'm working here.
   Get outta my way.
   You're bothering me.
   ~~~What's your job?
   ~~~You're not working...

   Can't you see me?
   I'm the overseer of these
   demi-humans working here.
   These guys always slack
   on the job if you don't
   watch 'em carefully.
   I need to keep my eyes peeled.

   What did you just say!?
   Maybe you don't get it,
   but I'm here to oversee
   these demi-humans.
   These guys always slack
   on the job if you don't
   watch 'em carefully.

 [Man]
   My, you folks are mighty
   anxious.
   Sorry, it'll be just a
   bit longer.
   I'll have these hot baked
   Viper Churros ready in
   a jiffy!
   What's that?
   You don't know what
   Viper Churros are?
   First, grind down Heckran
   bones, add a little water from
   Water Dragon Isle, then wrap 'em
   up with Beeba skin.
   You then add some sugar and
   spices, get steaming coals
   from Mount Pyre and bake 'em.
   For the finishing touch,
   we even add the famed
   '"Dragon's Glory!"'
   How 'bout it?
   Doesn't that tempt your appetite
   just hearing about it?
   It's a great day and I've
   scored a good place to sell.
   They'll sell like hotcakes
   today!
   
 [Boy]
   Me? I love boats!
   But I can't become a sailor,
   because I get seasick...
   That's why I decided to
   become a ship craftsman
   and build the fastest and
   awesomest boat ever made!
   So my first step is to watch all
   the boats here to research,
   research, and research.
   Ain't I smart?
   Out of all the boats I've seen,
   that boat at the docks is the
   best and fastest of them all.
   I wish I could build one like it...
   
   I want to make a cool
   boat like Korcha's
   someday...
   
 [Strange Woman]
   That's Korcha!
   He's from Guldove.
   I wonder why he hangs
   around here in Termina
   all the time?
   You shouldn't mess
   with the likes of him!
   I tell you...he's
   nothing but trouble!

   Do you have something you
   want to trade?
   ~~~Yes, I do
   ~~~No, maybe later
   
 
 [Man]
   Sigh...I overslept, and
   this corner's the only
   place open...

   To make things worse,
   the shrines are just past
   this point.
   They're called shrines, but
   they're really just a
   bunch of graves.
   I feel a bit uneasy...
   It's rumored that
   a possessed giant and a girl
   live in the shack near that
   shrine...

   Wow, big bro's got a great
   place to open shop.
   That spot's ideal for
   roadside merchants like us.
   Oops, no time to lose.
   I gotta hurry and set up myself...
   Please come back a

   Do you get my drift?
   ~~~Understood
   ~~~I don't understand

   So, you understand me.
   You're a nice guy.
   But I'm not giving you
   anything.

   So, you understand me.
   You're a nice guy.

   I don't mean to be harsh,

   Since the weather's so hot,

   cool to jump into the river.
   The dragons up in Mount Pyre
   must be acting up this year...
   Huh?
   You're asking if there's
   really a dragon there?010
   No, no, that's just folk tale.
   Besides, who wants to climb
   up that mountain, anyway?
   Unless you're some kinda
   crazy climber, that is.
   It's making me sweat just
   talking about it.
   
   I want to jump into the

   out here.
   
 [Man]
   Arrgh, they're not selling at all.
   A Viper Festival isn't
   a Viper Festival until ya
   have Viper Churros, right?
   This isn't going well.
   I'm setting a bad example
   for my little brother...

   Shoot, do you think
   100G is too much
   for one Churro?
   ~~~Too much
   ~~~About right
   ~~~That's cheap

   Just as I thought!!!
   I had a hunch that
   it was just a tad too
   much.

   How much would you charge for it?
   ~~~ [Amount]

   What, you want me to give'em
   away for free!?
   Tsk, I shouldn't have
   asked you.

   Isn't that waaay too cheap?
   I'm gonna lose money
   everytime I sell one.

   I'll be outta business
   within the hour at that
   price.

   Hmmm, maybe just a tad more.

   OK, then I'll lower the
   price a bit to match that.

   That's not so different
   from what it is now.

   Just as I thought!!!
   I knew it was just right.
   Then I'll try a little harder
   with this price.

   Just as I thought!!!
   I knew that I had it
   on the mark.
   Buy one from me!

   Viper Churro!
   Not bad...
   In fact, you feel
   revitalized!!!

 [Man]
   ...Oh,
   you don't even have
   100G.
   
   I lowered the price,
   just like you said.

   Master Gogh is an

   In his youth, the master was a

   had a frail constitution, she fell ill
   after the birth of the young master.
   Back then, the master was very poor...
   Without money to buy medicine,
   he could only watch her ladyship
   pass away. He changed that day.
   He started working constantly,
   without a moment's rest.
   My master's devotion to collecting
   all those works of art must be due
   to dreams he couldn't fulfill when
   he was younger.
   Oh, don't let this get out!

   accomplish anything
   meaningful...
   Of course, I have never stopped

   earned myself this nice house

   You have taken a Viper Churro...
   Not bad...
   And it even revitalizes you!
 
 [Inn, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Innkeeper]
   Welcome!!!
   Would you like to stay
   with us?
   One moment please...

   Ah yes, we have one room available.
   It is 100G. Do you wish to stay?
   ~~~Stay
   ~~~Not now

   Have a nice day!!!

   I'm sorry, but
   you don't have enough.

   I see.
   Please come again!!!
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   The inn is a hot spot
   for rogues and vagrants.
   I'm here checking
   for anyone suspicious.
   
 [Young Woman]
   Yesterday, we toured
   the place by boat!
   Oh, I highly recommend it!
   If you ask the boy near
   the shrines, he'll let
   you on the boat.

 [Young Woman]
   Hi-ho!
   
 [Young Man]
   Hi-ho!

 [Young Man]
   Yes, we did it!!!
   We just used the greeting
   we were taught by the hero,
   Pierre!

 [Young Woman]
   We are visitors
   vacationing from Porre.
   It's very beautiful out
   here, and the food is great!
   We've only got good things
   to say about this place!
   
 [Skelly's House, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Grandma]
   Yes?
   Who might you be?

 [Granddaughter]
   Grandma,
   they are travelers
   passing through.
   
 [Grandma]
   My, my, soo sorry.
   My eyes have become really
   weak in my old age, and I thought
   that my grandson had come back.
   My grandson was such a cute
   boy... He was really plump
   and cheerful...and loved to
   make people laugh.
   That's why the boy joined
   the circus to become a clown.
   For the first few years,
   he wrote letters to me
   almost daily.
   He always said how gratifying
   the work was, although it was
   very challenging...

   One day, his letters
   suddenly stopped coming.
   I haven't heard from him
   since.
   I hope he wasn't in an
   accident or something...
   I just pray that I might
   see his cheerful face once
   more, before the heavens
   come claim my soul...

   I just pray that I might
   see his cheerful face once
   more, before the heavens
   come claim my soul...

   You want to give me that?
   
 [Outside the Window]
 
 [Man]
   Would you like to buy
   a Viper Churro?

 [Customer]
   Hmmm...
   That's a reasonable price.
   Sure, I'll buy some
   for my kids.
   Wrap up four for me.
   Get me some big, fat
   ones.

   Thank you, sir!!!

   How much is it?
   
 [Man]
   Only 100G each!

 [Customer]
   Mm...
   Isn't that a bit much?
   Maybe next time.
   
   O-Oh, come on...
   
   Mm-mmm, smells dee-licious!
   I just can't wait 'til it's
   done cooking...
 
 [Sick Child's House, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Mother]
   ...And that is how the
   6 Great Dragons sealed the
   dark evil and restored
   peace to the land...
   The End!
   
 [Child]
   Mama, do dragons
   really exist?
   How big are they?

 [Mother]
   Oh, silly,
   this is a fairytale.
   The old people made it up.
   
 [Child]
   But, Mama, Korcha says
   dragons still exist.

 [Mother]
   !!!
   Are you still playing with
   that boy? How many times
   have I told you to stay away
   from him!?
   Besides, it's hocus-pocus
   like that, that's making
   Guldove so remote to
   us on the main island.
   Where in the world
   is there such a thing as
   the '"Dragon Tear"'?
   
 [Child]
   I'm sorry, Mama...
   But Korcha's stories
   are fun to listen to...
   The story he told last
   time about Master Viper's
   manor was so scary...!

 [Mother]
   No buts.
   Anything that boy says
   is a flat-out lie.
   Any child that believes in
   such nonsense is not a child
   of this family.
   
 [Child]
   No way!!!
   I belong to this
   family!!!
   Cough, Cough!!!

 [Mother]
   There, there.
   You're not going to get better
   if you don't listen to me.
   Now, if you promise me you won't
   play with Korcha anymore,
   I will tell the next story.
 [Child]
   U-Uh huh, I promise.
   So please, tell me
   the next story!!!

 [Mother]
   Yes, yes.
   What should I read
   you next?
   
   What story should I
   tell next?

 [Acacia Dragoon]
   I'm looking for a useful
   Element...

   Even for dragoons like us
   who train daily, Element
   selection is crucial.
   One selection can either
   make or break your
   advantage in battle. That's
   why it's so hard to choose...
   
 [Boy]
   There's so many, I
   can't decide which one...
   Mom said,
   '"You can only have
   one, because you're
   still a child!"'
   008Sigh...000grown-ups
   have all the fun...
   They get to mess with all
   those Elements, and we don't.
   
Lisa:
   You're not gonna find
   anything over here!
   
Lisa:
   Welcome...
   
Lisa:
   How may I help you?
   
Lisa:
   Oh, Leena!
   Don't expect any special deals
   just because I'm your friend!
   
[Lisa's Dad]
   Just the other day,
   I went on my usual trip
   to the Shadow Forest to
   gather wild plants.
   Believe it or not,
   I found a rare
   bluetip mushroom!
   How about that!
   Do you envy me?
   ~~~I envy you
   ~~~Not really

   I thought so, I thought so.
   To begin with, this mushroom
   only sprouts one day out of
   the year.

   Hmph, looks like you
   don't appreciate
   mushrooms at all.
   Oh well, never mind.

   OK, then I'm gonna tell
   you a big secret!
   Deep inside the forest,
   there is a very large tree.
   This tree has a big hole in it.
   This hole leads to an
   underground waterway, which
   is the perfect place for rare
   mushrooms to grow.
   If you go deeper into the
   waterway, you'll end up in
   Master Viper's manor!
   Does that surprise you!?
   Master Viper must also
   gather mushrooms in his
   spare time!
   He is a truly great man.
   Master Viper understands how
   to appreciate good mushrooms...
   What a wonderful lord he is.
 
 [The Dragon's Tail, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Man]
   Sigh...I've been fired from
   my job, and I'm really
   strapped for cash...
   But have you heard about this
   thing called the '"Frozen Flame"'?
   ~~~Yeah
   ~~~What's that?

   Whaaat?
   That thing is gonna
   be mine!
   Once you get your hands on
   it, you're guaranteed to
   be El Nido's, no, the
   world's richest man!
   That's what I call a
   '"Terminian Dream!!!"'
   What else can you call it?
   Alright!
   One more toast to my
   bright future!

   What, you haven't heard?
   Oh well, I was gonna keep it a
   secret, but I'll make an
   exception for you!
   The '"Frozen Flame"' is the
   treasure of treasures!
   It's the ultimate treasure in
   this world!
   It's rumored that the
   notorious thieves
   Radical Dreamers are also
   after it, but...
   That thing is MINE!
   One day, I'll get my hands on
   it and become the richest man
   in the universe!
   That's my '"Terminian Dream!!!"'
   Alright!
   One more toast to my bright
   future!
 
 [Man]
   This guy thinks that the
   '"Frozen Flame"' is some
   kind of jewel or something.
   I'd say things aren't that easy.
   It's probably a monster
   of some sort.
   Once you gaze at it,
   BOOM! You're well-done, like
   a steak on a barbecue.
   Well, you're free to dream, but
   daily work is always the best.
   Nothing beats hard work and
   dedication!!!

   Ever since Dario died,
   one of the chairs for the
   4 Devas of the Acacia Dragoons
   is vacant.
   Sir Viper is said to be
   looking for candidates...
   Yet, I can't foresee anyone
   who can match the caliber
   of the great knight Dario.
   If only I were a little
   younger...
   
 [Woman]
   I saw Miss Riddel visiting
   the shrines again.
   She made a darling couple
   with her childhood
   sweetheart, Dario.
   It's such a pity that he
   died so young...
   They say beautiful women
   rarely find happiness...
   How about me? Do I look happy?
   ~~~You look happy
   ~~~You look unhappy

   So you mean I'm not
   beautiful then...!?

   Oh my, do I...?
   Why, thank you, although
   I know it's just flattery!

   Welcome to the

   You're travelers, aren't
   you? That's OK, I can tell
   by the way you look.
   So what do you
   think of Termina?
   This port town just
   loves travelers.
   I love this town...
   and all of its people,
   whether they are residents
   or travelers!

 [Man]
   Barkeep! One more order
   of squid gut pasta!!!

 [Barkeep]
   More?
   That's all you eat.
   Try some of the other
   dishes, will you!

 [Man]
   Hehehe!!!
   The better tasting it is,
   the faster I eat it up!

   Geez, right when we were
   in the middle of a good
   conversation...

   In order to wake up the
   monster blocking the path...

   Use an Aroma Pouch and
   check all the plant life.
   Some of the plants will
   be attracted to the aroma.

   There are monsters in the
   forest that eat the pollen
   given off by these plants.
   Use the pollen to lure these
   monsters to the monster
   blocking the path.

   Once you wake it up, all
   you have to do is defeat it...
   But in my case...
   It defeated me...

   I leave this helpful note
   for anyone who wishes to
   get through...
   

   There are blue berries growing.

   Random numbers won't work.

   And don't walk in the

   Got that?
   
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Ever since the general's guest
   showed up, monsters have been
   popping up inside the manor.
   I don't want to dishonor the
   general's guest, but I have
   a bad feeling about him.

   You know the monsters that
   peep through the doors...?
   You can get by them when
   they shut their eyes.
   
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   An envoy from Porre
   is here about
   the Frozen Flame.

   But I get the feeling he

   off the trap again.
   He's still an apprentice

   I can understand the pressure
   he feels, though, having a brother
   who was one of the 4 Devas...

 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Hey, do you guys have
   the flu or something?

   walk around, huh?
   Here, take this Medicine

   There's going to be a grand
   expedition sometime soon.
   Most of the dragoons will
   be setting out.

   But, then, I wonder who's
   going to defend our manor?
   I just hope the Porre military
   from the mainland doesn't
   invade this place.
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
    That Glenn over there is the
    younger brother of Dario, one
   of the 4 Dragoon Devas.
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
    Have you seen the
    machinery outside?
    Miss Luccia has taken broken
    parts from Fort Dragonia
    and is using them to
    remodel that thing.

    Those parts are actually weaponry
    from an ancient, lost supercivilization.
    She's quite the genius to be
    able to work with them.
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   It's been 3 years since
   Sir Dario's death...
   Miss Riddel has been
   heavy-hearted since, and it
   feels as though all the life
   went out in this manor.

   General Viper doesn't show it,
   but I'm sure he, too, is
   suffering inside.
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Zzzz... Zzzz...

   All he does is sleep.

   Sorry to be abrupt, but have you
   ever come across a '"shiny material?"'
   ~~~...Shiny material?
   ~~~I've seen it

   Elements are common items
   nowadays, but there's a special
   kind called '"Summon Elements."'
   096This kind releases awesome power
   depending on one of the six attributes...
   The '"shiny material"' is a mysterious
   byproduct of this phenomenon.

   This material is an essential
   item for craftsmen to forge
   advanced weapons, armor,
   and accessories.
   Still, everything depends on
   the skill of the craftsman.

   I've heard that a skilled
   craftsman can create
   advanced weapons and
   armor from the shiny material.
   Although they're all called shiny,
   there are several different kinds.
   Keep your eyes peeled for them.

   To the north of this village
   lies Earth Dragon Isle,
   which we locals call '"The Land
   Where the Dragon Sleeps."'
   Until a few years ago, the
   surface was covered with sand,
   but somehow, the sand disappeared
   completely overnight.

   From what I've heard from another
   traveler, the once plentiful water
   on Water Dragon Isle has completely
   dried up due to abnormal weather...
   
 [Boy]
   You're new around here,
   aren't you?
   Do you know what these
   wires are for?

   If you don't know, I'll teach
   you for a special price of 5G.
   ~~~That's OK, I already know
   ~~~Alright, I'll pay the 5G
   ~~~I'm not interested
   
   Do you reeeally know?
   That's kinda fishy...
   Oh well, if you already know,
   that'll make things easier.
   
   So, what's it gonna be?
   You're talking to me because
   you wanna do it, right?
   ~~~Of course, I do
   ~~~Maybe later

   Before teaching you, I'll
   need that 5G, hehe!


 [Boy]
   OK, here goes a quick
   rundown of the whole
   gadget.
   This wire connects to the docks.
   There's also a second wire
   connected to the shrine.
   Basically, it's a shortcut
   to the docks. You can get
   there a lot faster than
   walking, plus it feels great!
   Well, the only problem is
   that you can't come back.
   You can't defy gravity, you
   know?

   Hey, wait a minute.
   You don't even have 5G?
   Whoa...that's sad.

   Oh, man.
   That's no fun.
   I think it's a good buy? Tsk!

   It'll be 10G in advance.
   ~~~Pay 10G
   ~~~No thanks
   

 [Boy]
   Hehe, thanks!

   Say, have you ever heard of the

   the evil and promise eternal

   Yes? Do you want to become the wind?
   ~~~Not now

   This is the Dragon Shrine,

   As a man of the sea, you gotta
   be on your toes whether you're
   on land or manning the ship!
   I always pay close attention to
   my Element placement! You have
   to think about terrain and attribute
   conditions, so it's pretty complicated.
   
 [Demi-human Man]
   Far off in the eastern El Nido
   sea, there is a village '"Marbule,"'
   homeland to us demi-humans...
   But my friends there hate humans.
   
   Once upon a time, I heard that
   humans and demi-humans lived in
   harmony on the mainland.
   I wish we could go back to that time.
   
 [Demi-human Woman]
   We're a small village, but we
   have some rare Elements you
   won't find in bigger towns.
   ~~~Let me take a look
   ~~~Maybe next time

   Thank you very much.
   Please be careful when
   travelling the seas.
   Have a safe voyage!

   Please stop by again if
   you visit the village.
   ...Have a safe voyage.

   Hey, you're an unfamiliar face.

   well, so out you go.
   You're in my way.
 
 [Dwarf]
   That wind brings back memories...
   Hey, boy, you're from the main island?
   Do you know the Hydra Marshes?
   It's the forest to the southeast.
   Although they're called the
   Hydra Marshes, there are
   no more Hydras there.
   Everyone left that forest
   after the Hydras died off.
   I, too, left the forest...
   That place ain't fit for
   living creatures anymore.
   
   Hi-ho, the plants in the marshes
   respond to the sounds of this tinkler.
   It ain't no good to me anymore.
   Here, I'll give this to you, boy!
   
   You just go up to a plant and
   ring it......
   like that. The plant will open up
   a path without you touching it.
   
   Green Tinkler.
   
 [Dwarf]
   ...It used to be so good back then.
   Without the Hydra, that forest
   is doomed...
   
 [Man]
   It hasn't rained around here
   for the longest time.
   The traders say the water on
   Water Dragon Isle has dried up, too...

 [Man]
   We don't get much news of the
   main island out here.
   Judging from the season, I guess it's
   about time the El Nido Festival starts.

   I heard the Radical Dreamers
   broke into Viper Manor to
   search for the '"Frozen Flame."'
   Ha, I don't know what they
   were thinking. Even Master
   Viper wouldn't have
   such a valuable treasure.
   
 [Woman]
   The thieves that broke
   into Viper Manor took
   Miss Riddel hostage and

   Luckily, Miss Riddel was
   all right, but the dragoons
   are still looking for the
   thieves.

   Did you hear?
   There's a rumor that Karsh
   plotted Dario's death!
   I know it sounds odd, but the
   two were longtime rivals.
   Also, Karsh was the only one
   there when Dario died.

   Mama said he's gone
   on a long trip on his

   If I weren't so sick,
   I would've gone out
   to search for him.
   
   But Korcha will find
   papa for me.
   On that beautiful boat,
   right?
   Korcha is so admirable.
   He never complains to anyone
   that he doesn't have a father.
   Mama will understand some
   day that Korcha is such
   a nice person...

   What is it...?
   
   Someone always brings
   Drakehorn grass and leaves
   it here for us...

   Don't go trying any
   '"Dwarf Tossing"' now,
   you hear!?
   
   Aha... So you noticed.
   That's a rare plant you'll only
   find growing in Hydra Marshes.
   If you touch it and talk to it,
   it bends backwards for a little
   while to form a bridge.

   I think the dwarves may have
   planted those. See how they're
   strategically placed?
   I believe there's another way to bend
   them without actually having to touch
   them... I don't know the details, though.

   The dwarves dwelling in this
   forest would probably know,
   but they hate humans.
   They wouldn't tell us...
   
   Hey, you don't look so well.
   Don't tell me you touched
   one of those Potpourris?
   They won't hurt you if you

   You may have already seen
   the Black Dragon residing
   in our village.
   It has been asleep for
   many a year now.
   No one knows why, but
   the last ruling elder
   spoke the following:
   '"The black dream of the Black
   Dragon... Unable to return,
   it continues to wander..."'
   I know not what it means.
   
Ruling Elder:
   I strongly urge that you
   not go near there.

Ruling Elder:
   '"The black dream of the Black
   Dragon... Unable to return,
   it continues to wander..."'
   I know not what it means.
   
 [Witch Doctor's House, Marbule (Another)}
   
Witch Doctor:
   What is it, human?
   What are you doing here?

Witch Doctor:
   You humans are an ill omen...
   This dates back 14 years,
   when I was informed that
   humans were on their way
   to Marbule.
   That day, I witnessed the
   most terrifying storm I
   have ever seen. Those
   humans never showed up.
   I was sure they were
   swallowed by the storm.
   ......
   However, that very day,
   I heard a rumor...
   A rumor that someone had
   made his way through
   the Pearly Gates.
   Perhaps they did survive
   that storm...
   Ahh, it no longer matters
   now. The elder who knew
   about this incident passed
   away years ago.

Witch Doctor:
   My point is, humans are
   bad luck! Now leave!
   
 [Sky Dragon Isle (Another)]
 
 [Explorer]
   This island is considered holy
   ground by local residents220
   it is considered taboo to come near it.
   But there is no such thing as taboo
   for the adventurous spirit.
   
 [Explorer Captain]
   This island is said to be
   where the Sky Dragon resides,
   but it seems to have gone away.

   There's supposedly artifacts
   of the legendary Dragonites
   underground here.
   
 [Explorer]
   About a hundred years before
   humans from the continent came here,
   the Dragonians and demi-humans
   still existed in great numbers.

   This island is an ancient ruin
   of the Dragonians.
   
 [Earth Dragon Isle (Another)]
 
 [Explorer]
   This big hole leads to
   an underground cavern.
   Some of our men are
   down there now.

   It may be worthwhile to
   check it out.
   It's pretty incredible
   down there.
   
Captain:
   The locals call this island,
   '"Earth Dragon Isle,"'
   but it's also known as
   '"The Land Where the Dragons Sleep."'
   Our investigation has revealed
   nothing about this so-called dragon...
   This legendary dragon must be a hoax.

Captain:
   It's hard to believe just by
   looking around, but this island
   used to be covered with sand.
   See that big hole in the middle?
   That's where the quicksand was.
   It's still a mystery how all
   that sand disappeared.
   
 [Inner Earth Dragon Isle (Another)]
 
 [Explorer]
   I can't believe people would
   actually come down here.
   What are you just curious,
   or just stupid?

   Heh heh...
   Sorry, I'm just rude by nature.
   Don't let it bother you.

   When you want to go back
   above ground, just jump
   into that sand boil.
   It'll shoot you right back up.
   It's quite a rush going
   through that thing.
   But just watch out you don't
   sprain your ankle when you land.

   If you have trouble running,
   that means you have a sprain.
   You should take care of it with
   Brace right away.
   
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No
   
 [Explorer]
   There's no point exploring
   any further.
   You'll find a big opening, but
   there are monsters everywhere.

   We actually found another sand
   boil like the one over there,
   but it's dead...non-functional.
   There's also that elevated area
   which seems to lead to another
   room...
   
   the explorers were talking about.
   It's not functioning, though.
   
 [Forbidden Island]
 
 [Demi-human]
   What brings you here to a
   desolate place like this?

   It's more or less your
   fault that we demi-
   humans are condemned.

   There were a lot more
   of us when I was a kid.
   We used to live south
   of Arni Village.

   We used to go play at
   Divine Dragon Falls.
   I wonder if it's still there?
   
 [Water Dragon Isle (Another)]
 
 [Explorer Captain]
   It's hard to believe, but according
   to the fairies here, the legendary
   '"Dragon God"' really exists...
   That thick wall of ice blocking
   the entrance into the underground
   cavern proves it.
   El Nido sure is full of mysteries!

   In El Nido, I've heard that the
   people sometimes refer to the
   Dragon Gods as '"Gods of Nature."'
   If you take a different perspective,
   you can say the dragon's powers
   are the forces of nature.
   If anyone got a hold of
   such power...
   It's frightening just
   to think about it.
   
 [Explorer]
   The forces of nature are astonishing.
   This place we're standing was
   covered with water just a few
   days ago.
   But now, it's run dry due to
   the unusual weather we've been
   having lately.
   It's not a pretty sight.

 [Explorer]
   As of late, everyone's talking
   about the existence of dragons.
   We adventurers have been researching
   it for a while now, though.

   Rumor has it that the major power,
   Porre, is going to investigate these
   islands in full force... That's going
   to make our research a lot tougher...
   
 [Explorer]
   Ever since I found that bone, a strange
   skeleton thingy has been haunting my
   dreams saying, '"Put my body back
   together."' It's been driving me nuts!
   Well, now I can say goodbye to that
   nightmare. I'm sorry about you guys,
   but just think of it as helping
   others out, will ya?
   
 [Green Fairy]
   Although we can fly, we fairies
   aren't fairy strong and we can't
   fly too far.
   It's a different story if we
   can catch the wind, but the wind
   is capricious, just like we are.

   This was a while back, but one
   fairy was blown away by a strong
   wind and has been lost ever since.
   The wind isn't always on our side...
   it sometimes betrays us and
   brings sadness upon us.
   
 [Pink Fairy]
   We fairies are born from the morning
   dewdrops of an aged tree.
   The large tree that stands in the
   center is like our '"Fairy Godmother."'
   
 [Blue Fairy]
   The mist of the sea
   is an invitation to the dark...
   Embracing the abyssmal darkness,
   where the lost souls gather...

   They come seeking the warm
   and radiant glow of life,
   a victim to share their sufferings...
   Be careful, be careful...

 [Orange Fairy]
   Did you hear? Did you hear? Did you hear?
   A small star fell into the
   sea of the Triplet Isles!
   But that was a long time ago...

   Listen, listen, listen.
   The bottom of the sea glowed!
   It's an old story...
   from a time when storms
   raged and the heaven and
   earth trembled.
   
Rosetta:
   Dear sirs, have you come to this
   island seeking the Dragon God?
   If so, please turn back now.
   Due to the abnormal weather
   conditions, the fountain has
   run completely dry.
   This island, once called the
   '"Island of Springs,"'
   is desolate, as you now see...

Rosetta:
   The Water Dragon once reigned
   over this island.
   But that was long ago...
   The entrance to the
   underground caverns has now
   been completely sealed, and
   it is impossible to enter...

   All is well!!!
   Ain't nothin' but
   peace and harmony!
   
 [Pirate]
   Oh man...I'm hungry.
   I'm gettin' sick of eatin'
   fish everyday...
   
 [Pirate]
   I can't believe they put me
   in charge of the kitchen just
   cuz I lost the poker game...
   They know I ain't no cook,
   so they should stop gripin'!

 [Pirate]
   Yeah...yeah...
   So you got brawn.
   
 [Pirate]
   Ahoy, mateys!
   How goes it?
   ~~~We're just about to leave
   ~~~Just dropping by
   
   Well, then,

 [Arni (Home)]
 
 [Old Man]
   Many say it's better
   for people to stay away
   from that island.
   But I guess what
   has to be done,
   MUST be done...

   So what is it?
   Did you forget your spare
   bandana there or something?
   
   Well? I'll take you
   there for 100G.
   What do want to do?
   
 [Water Dragon Isle (Home)]
 
 [Old Man]
   I'll be here waiting, so
   run along and hurry back.

Dwarf Chieftain:
   We shall live quietly,
   deep within this forest
   with the Hydra.
   
DaggyDwarf:
   We are happy as long as
   we have this forest,
   hi-ho...

DaffyDwarf:
   The rest of our clan should be
   returning to the forest soon.
   In the meantime, the 3 of us
   will do what we can.

   We Dragonians are

   Thou must change the
   order of the head, body,
   and tail to unveil
   a new path.

   Let it be the tail, body, then head.

   Let it be the tail, head, then body.
   
   Let it be the body, head, then tail.

   Let it be the body, tail, then head.

 [Hydra Marshes (Home)]
 
 [Explorer]
   After we defeated the Hydra,
   the forest dwellers kept
   murmuring...
   '"The forest will die..."'
   I can't get it out of my head...!
   
 [Explorer]
   We defeated the '"Hydra"'
   that lived in this forest.
   If you want to know more, go
   talk to our leader further down.

   I don't know about here, but
   over on the mainland, the
   flesh and blood of a Hydra
   fetch a really high price.

   Looks like it was used
   to trap something...
 
 [Explorer Captain]
   You folks here to hunt down
   Hydras, too?
   Unfortunately, there's not a
   single one left in this forest.
   I think we got the last one.
   Ohhh yeah!
   We can sell this baby for a
   fortune!

   Huh? Dwarves?
   Oh, you mean the big-nosed
   inhabitants of this forest?
   Heh... We took care of them, too.
   They were even kind enough, or
   should I say stupid enough, to
   lead us to the Hydra.
   Who gives a crap about them, right?

   be completed soon.
   P-Please don't scratch

   A-Ahhh!!!
   O-Our investigation
   should be over soon.
   P-Please don't stare
   me down like that!

   Why does he look like that!?
   What is he!?

 [Old Man]
   I have nothing
   to say to you
   demi-humans!
   Now git the hell
   outta our village!
   Accursed monsters!
   
 [Woman]
   Oh my...
   What parts do
   you hail from?
   Well, it doesn't much
   matter to me.
   Customers are my business!
   
   How can I help you?

   ~~~No, thank you
   ~~~Show me your Elements
   ~~~Show me your Weapons/Armor 

   I don't like
   window-shoppers.
   Would you stop
   loitering!? You're
   hurting my business!

   Alrighty!
   Just a minute,
   please!

   Thanks.
   Come again.
   
 [Old Man]
   Well,
   hello there......
   Huh?
   Who are you folks...?
   Demi-humans, eh?
   Just don't cause
   any trouble in
   our village, OK?
   
 [Old Woman]
   It's been quite a
   while since I
   enountered a demi-
   human in this village.
   I hear you only find
   demi-humans in Guldove 
   and aboard the Zelbess
   these days.
   
 [Boy]
   Wow, awesome!
   You're for real, right?
   Are you a human-cat?
   Or a cat-human?
   Do you like catnip?

   Well? Do you like catnip?
   ~~~Of course!
   ~~~Whatever...

   I thought so!
   I guess you
   are what you eat.
   Grandma also told me
   that how you look on
   the outside is a reflection
   of what's in your heart.

   You don't like it!?
   Just because you look
   like a cat doesn't
   mean you are one...?
   Oh... Then you're no
   different than us.
   How boring.
   
   Just because you look it,
   doesn't mean you are.
   Then I guess appearance
   doesn't show what's
   in your heart...

   I guess appearance
   speaks for what you are...
   Grandma was right.
   Your appearance shows people
   what's in your heart.
   
 [Man]
   AHHH...!?
   W-W-Who are you!?
   What do you want!?
   Ohh... I know...
   You're after my
   sawfish, aren't you?
   Am I right?

   Well, I got no fishes
   for a stray cat like you!
   Now, scram!
   Shoo-shoo!
   
   Hey, that's an amulet made
   from a lion shark tooth.
   It's huge!
   Wait a minute...
   Isn't this Kiki's dad's?
   What are you
   doing with it?
 
 [Kiki's Dad]
   I don't know what your
   reason for being here is,
   but I suggest you leave quietly
   before anything happens to you.
   Our village doesn't take
   too kindly to demi-humans.
   I don't mean any harm.
   Please, just leave.
   
 [Old Woman]
   Ly...
   Lynx...!?

   Aghhh...!
   Please... Just don't
   wreck our boats...!
   Please, I beg of you!
   We live a quiet, humble life
   in this here village.
   There is no way any of
   us would oppose you!

   I don't want anything.
   Please, just leave our village!
   
 [Girl]
   You sure do dress
   funny, mister.
   You look like a
   cute kitty-cat!!!
   
 [Man]
   Hmmm....
   The Record of Fate makes
   no mention of me meeting
   a demi-human...
   No, no, you must
   be mistaken.
   The Record of Fate
   never makes mistakes.
   
 [Old Woman]
   Gonji will never live
   up to Radius's legacy
   as village chief!
   Oh, Chief Radius,
   please come back soon.
   
 [Gonji]
   Gonji:
   I don't talk to
   demi-humans!
   Now, scram!
   
 [Old Man]
   Huaaaaaah...
   What? I don't have
   any business with
   you demi-humans.
   If I let you on my boat,
   I might end up waking
   up the dead!
   I'm very superstitious
   you know.
   How do you think I lived
   to be this old?
   
 [Chief's Hut, Arni (Home)]
 
 [Man]
   Well, well, this is unusual.
   What business does a demi-human
   like you have with the chief?
   The chief isn't here.
   He said he was going
   out for a stroll.
   
   It says,
   ~~'"The ecstasy and anxiety
   ~~  of the chosen one..."'
   It appears fate has chosen
   you to face a great test, too.
   One of joy, anguish and...
   You will face great hardship,
   but it is unavoidable.
   No one can do this but you...
   
 [Woman]
   You're not from
   this village, are you?
   But then again, you're
   not even human!
   You have some nerve
   trying to use our
   Record of Fate!
   Go somewhere else!
   
 [Old Man]
   Yowzer!
   I thought you
   were Serge!
   
 [Belcha's Kitchen, Arni (Home)]
 
 [Poet Girl]
   Oh, hi there.
   Don't worry. I don't judge
   books by their covers.
   You can talk to me...
   But...actually...
   You really are quite
   scary looking...
   Please go away.
   Hey! Why don't you go
   talk to our chief, Radius!?
   You might wind up in a fight,
   hanging around here.
   
   I haven't seen the president
   of my fan club in a while...
   I wonder what he's up to?
   Of course I'm talking
   about Serge...
   Where could he be?
   I need to express myself!
   I know! I'll have the village
   chief listen to my new poem.
   Chief Radius is a patient man.
   
   You might be giving the
   wrong message by showing
   girls all those items.
   That's just my opinion.

   It's a collection of
   all my work.
   I've never shown it
   to anyone...
   Come on, put it away.
   It's embarrassing!
   Say hi to the
   other me for me.
   
 [Belcha]
   Yes, what is it?
   Has word of my gourmet
   cooking even reached the
   ears of you demi-humans?
   Huh? No!?
   Then whatCHA doin' in here?
   Can'tCHA see you're hurtin'
   my business!
 
 [Old Man]
   Hmmm... The demi-human, Lynx?
   I may have heard something
   about him when I was in Termina...
   I don't recall the details,
   but I believe he was a
   good friend of General Viper...
   Don't tell me you're...
   
 [Man]
   Yo, demi-human.
   Have you heard anything
   about them group of thieves
   up on the mainland?
   If you ask me, you guys
   look a lot more menacing
   than those Radical Dreamers
   I've been hearin' about.
   Hey, man, I'm just kidding!
   They say cats have 9 lives,
   but watch it there, fella.
   The village folk have a short temper.
   
 [Kiki's House]
 
 [Old Man]
   Oh, a feline demi-human.
   I've never seen anything
   like you... Are you from
   the Zenan continent?
   I've heard about a man
   named Lynx who used
   to visit General Viper
   up in Termina...
   Could you be him?
   
 [Kiki's Mom]
   Oh my!
   Who may I ask are you?
   I don't believe we know
   any demi-humans...
   If there is nothing in
   particular, I ask that you
   please leave. It may not
   seem so, but we are busy.

   Please, I don't
   want anything!
   Just leave, please!
   
 [Kiki]
   EeeeeeeK!
   H-H-Hello...
   Are you a friend of my daddy?
   ...Umm, umm... Mister...?
   Aren't you hot in
   those clothes?

   Yikes!
   I-I-It's nothing!
   I-I-I'm sorry!

   HUH!?
   Is that...
   a Komodo dragon scale!?

   No, but I can't.
   I'll get in trouble if
   I accept stuff from strangers.
   
   Please, Mister!
   Please don't eat
   my Celine!
   
   Mister...
   Are you......
   A circus-freak?
   
 [Kiki's Dad]
   Well, what a surprise.
   How long's it been since
   I last saw a demi-human?
   
   WHAT!?
   YOU'RE Serge!?
   Oh... Hahahahaha!
   That's a good one!
   Hahahahaha...! So, how does
   Serge end up becoming
   a terrifying demi-human
   like you? Hahaha...

   A word of advice.
   Don't go telling this to
   everyone you see. The villagers
   might not find it funny.
   We villagers don't take too
   kindly to demi-humans, and
   everyone here likes Serge.
   
   Wait a minute...!
   That's the amulet
   I gave to Serge!
   But why do you have it?
   You haven't done anything
   to Serge, have you!?
 
 [Leena's House, Arni (Home)]
 
 [Leena's Grandma]
   Look here! That cat
   belongs to me!
   She is not your lunch,
   got it!?
   
   Are you trying to
   abduct me using
   that as bait?
   For a cute
   girly like me!?
   Hwa-hwa-hwa...!
   
   It's been a long time
   since I've seen a demi-human.
   Have the gates to the
   great beyond opened up?
   I just hope nothing
   bad happens...
   Hwa-Hwa-Hwa...
   
 [Arni (Home)]
 
Gonji:
   Don't worry, Chief.
   I'll take care of everything
   while you're away.
   Just take it easy
   and go do what
   you got to do.
   
Gonji:
   I don't have time
   for that right now.
   
 [Old Woman]
   I hope Chief Radius
   returns to our
   village safely.
   I've been overcome with
   fear lately. Ohh, please
   watch over us...
 
 [Man]
   Chief Radius,
   please be careful.
   We shall follow the
   Record of Fate
   and do our best!
   
 [Girl]
   Hi, Chief!
   Come back soon for
   story time, OK?
   
 [Chief's Hut, Arni (Home)]
 
 [Old Man]
   Hello, Chief.
   Looks like the time has finally
   come to face your past.
   Please be careful.
   Everyone in the village will
   pray for your safe return.
   
 [Girl]
   Chief Radius, will
   you be leaving us?
   Please take care of yourself.
   We will all pray for
   your safe return.
   
 [Woman]
   Oh, Chief. Is it true that
   you're leaving the village
   for a while? Don't worry, I'll
   take care of the Record of Fate.
   
 [Girl]
   Chief, does the Record of
   Fate speak of anything?
   What kind of future
   is in store for us?
   
 [Man]

   Compared to the mainland,

   here cannot be matched.
   I'm thinking of moving
   over here permanently to
   enjoy the country life.
  
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander Norris is at the
   ruins of Viper Manor.
   Please report your current
   status immediately!

 [Man]
   Argh, it's such a pity...
   The statue of Master Viper
   that I've polished everyday
   has been changed to this...
   The once magnificent manor
   is also long gone.
   If only Master Viper were
   here, none of this would've
   happened...

   !!!
   I-If it isn't Sir Lynx!!
   I-It's a great relief
   that you're safe...
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   This is the Porre Army's
   state-of-the-art weaponry.
   As long as we have this,
   the citizens of Termina
   wouldn't dare revolt
   against us.
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   We will open fire on any
   suspicious ship, if they
   do not respond to our call.
   When you travel by ship,
   I advise you to be careful.
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   Inform me immediately
   if you find anything.
   
 [John]
   Huff, huff...
   The key to gunfights is
   balance! It's not just
   a matter of shooting!!!

   myself to stay on my toes!
   Phew...
   Mr. Norris must have gotten

   From what I've heard,

   Some people claim to have seen
   him, so we're currently looking
   for this '"Dario,"' but...
   Just when we thought the
   Acacia Dragoons were gone,
   this troublemaker decides
   to come back...
   If you find any information
   about him, let us know.

 [Porre Soldier]
   This Dario person seems to

   Just last night, a man's spirit
   appeared at my bedside...
   He said his name was
   '"Ghetz"' or something.
   He's probably another

   to this world.
   Very common around here.

 [Porre Soldier]
   Even though I'm here relaxing,
   I can't shake away this mystery
   from my mind...
   Will you listen to my story?
   ~~~Sure
   ~~~No, not now

   It happened about
   3 years ago...
   General Viper and his men
   disappeared from the manor.
   We searched the manor for
   them, but found no traces.
   I can only guess that they
   were spirited away.
   What in the world could
   have happened...
   To think that the same
   thing could happen
   to me someday...
   I just can't help being
   afraid, even when I'm
   trying not to think
   about it...

   Too bad...
   Then I will keep this
   story to myself...
   
 [Porre Man]
   The '"Dragon's Glory"' is

   It seeps down deep, just as it's

   And this rare, dried lizard

   Of course, you can't forget the local
   specialty: squid gut pasta either.
   And that's how I get
   fatter with each one...
   
 [Porre Woman]
   It's been quite some
   time since I've been
   around here, but...
   It's nice and peaceful

   Maybe I should just
   stay here forever...

   Will you listen to my story?
   ~~~Fine, let's hear it
   ~~~No, not now

   As you already know,
   Commander Norris,
   it's already been
   three years...
   3 years since General
   Viper and his men
   disappeared from the manor.
   We found no traces of
   them, even after a thorough
   investigation.
   I can only guess that they

   to me someday...

   ~~~Sure
   ~~~No thanks, not now

   You have a pretty good collection.
   Still, you'd be better off just
   trading the unneeded ones
   rather than keeping them.

   Oh well, that's fine with me.
   But having a lot of Elements

 [Explorer]
   You're travelers, aren't you?
   Have you guys heard about the
   '"Star Fragment?"'
   ~~~Star Fragment?
   ~~~Yep, I've heard

   The sea near Triplet Isles...
   Locals call it the
   '"El Nido Triangle."'
   In that area, you can find
   pretty star-shaped stones.
   That's why they're called
   Star Fragments.

   It doesn't have much value
   other than being pretty.
   But, I believe it brings
   good luck to its bearer.
   That's why I'm carrying one
   around like this.
   Going off the subject, this
   El Nido Triangle is a strange place.
   If you go a little underwater,
   there's a layer of air where you
   can actually walk around just like
   on land. You'll be surprised!
   
Then have you heard about that
   monster on Sky Dragon Isle?
   ~~~Monster?
   ~~~Of course I have
   
   One of our members investigated
   Sky Dragon Isle.
   That guy was carrying around
   the Star Fragment, like I do.
   When he was searching for artifacts
   at the ruins, he was mugged by
   a GIGANTIC monster and his Star
   Fragment was taken away.

   The funny thing about it was that
   the guy himself wasn't injured.
   Yeah, I tell you. If I'd been there at
   the time, it would've gotten me, too!
   Am I lucky or what?
   I owe it all to this Star Fragment.
   Huh...? Wait a minute...then why
   did he get mugged?

   ......
   You guys are really adventurers
   in disguise, aren't you?
   
   That area is a famous spot
   where a fallen star is
   supposed to have landed.
   It's rumored that there is a
   layer of air at the bottom
   of the ocean as a side-effect
   from its crash!

   El Nido sure has a lot
   of mysterious things lying
   around.
   
   I heard that a Dragon God used
   to live on Sky Dragon Isle.
   Originally, all the islands
   with dragon names had living
   Dragon Gods on them.
   Sand Dragon Isle that our
   expedition is investigating up
   north is one such island.
   But we've only found sand and rocks.

   Far east from here, there's
   an area called the '"Dead Sea"'
   that's covered by thick clouds
   all year long.
   The strange thing about it
   is that there's no way in.
   Poisonous coral surrounds the
   whole area.

   Even the Porre military, who's
   causing trouble around El Nido,
   gave up after several tries.
   
 [Explorer]
   Say, have you heard?
   An ancient Dragonian artifact called
   the '"Dragon Tear"' is enshrined
   somewhere in this village.

   If it's really a Dragonian artifact,
   then it's an ancient treasure!
   It could be as valuable as the
   rumored '"Frozen Flame!"'
   That might be an overstatement,
   but in any case I'd love to see this
   Dragon Tear at least once!

   the monster would've taken my
   life instead.

   The Star Fragment is found
   at the bottom of the sea in
   an area called El Nido Triangle.
   Even though it's on the ocean floor,
   there is a layer of air and you can
   walk around with ease.
   
 [Explorer]
   The El Nido Triangle is rumored to
   have been blasted by a fallen star.
   
 [Explorer]
   Perhaps this could be the site
   of the ancient Dragonites.
   
   There are many stone statues
   lined up under this tree.
   
 [Explorer]
   There's a gigantic monster here!

   It seems that the monster won't
   attack you if you don't have
   a Star Fragment.

   If you want to meet the
   monster, why don't you
   go get the Star Fragment
   from the El Nido Triangle?
   But be warned that the
   Star Fragment is inside a
   Schoolmate's nest though!
   
   Nooo, it's heeeeere!!!
   
   Hah, so the main body was
   just a little guy, eh?

   Hah haha!

   Hah haha!
   You're just jealous!
   
 [Woman]
   I can't wait to see
   Nikki's concert!
   That ship you're
   looking at belongs
   to Nikki!
   He tours the world
   on that ship.
   Ohh...Nikki, take
   me with you!!!
   
   OH MY GAWD!!!
   NIKKI!!!!!!
   
 [Man]
   She brings me a cocktail
   when I'm thirsty...
   Gives me a massage
   when I'm tense...
   Now this is what being
   on a cruise ship is
   all about!
   
 [Man]
   Have you guys been to
   an island called Marbule?
   It used to be a beautiful
   island where mermaids lived.
   But now, it's infested by
   nasty-lookin' monsters.
   That's where all the demi-human
   workers on this ship are from.
   Hey, come on!
   Don't look at me like that!
   The demi-humans say they're
   happy to just have jobs and
   receive food for wages.
   
 [Roadie]

   OK, let me explain the rules
   for Compass Roulette.
   Don't worry, it's real simple.

   OK, I'm going to spin the pointer,
   so you just stop it whenever you

   If the pointer stops on north,
   JACKPOT!
   You double your points.

   Again...

   If the pointer stops on east,
   you win 50 points.

   Next...

   If the pointer stops on west,
   you lose 50 points.

   And finally,
   if the pointer stops on south...

   DEATH!
   Everything you've earned
   up to now...down the drain!

   Do you understand the rules?
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~Explain again
   ~~~Try it

   We also have the '"Sudden
   Death"' rule in Vegas Casino,
   but I'll explain it to you
   when the time comes!

   Current Points: [Value]
   ~~~Continue
   ~~~Quit

   Alright!
   You win 50 points!

   DEATH!!!

   Oh no...
   You lose 50 points.

   JACKPOT!
   You doubled your points!

   Ooooh, that's too bad...
   You lost all your points.
   Better luck next time...

   Alright, I think you've
   had enough, guy.
   You'll put this casino

   Tch!
   Nikki this and Nikki that!
   That's all I hear on this ship!
   What's the big deal anyway!?
   Look at the way he dresses...
   And he wears makeup, too!
   A man has to be tough!
   Be a man, I say!
   
 [Woman]
   Oh...Nikki...
   Just looking at your poster
   makes my head spin...
   If I see you in person,
   I will probably faint...
   If that should happen,
   please, Nikki...!
   Squeeze me in your arms!
   
 [Woman]
   I wish Nikki's concert
   would start soon...
   It took me 6 months to
   save enough money for
   this event.
   I had to sacrifice my

   Um... Do you know what's
   happening in Marbule?
   ~~~It's as beautiful as ever
   ~~~Too painful to say...

   Good...
   I wish I could go
   back there one day...
   Hey, do you know how
   this ship got its name?
   ~~~No, tell me
   ~~~Yes, I do

   OK, sure.
   There once was a beautiful
   love that flourished
   in Marbule...
   A love between a human
   and a mermaid...
   The mermaid's name was Zelbess,
   Irenes's sister.
   And the human was...

   ...I'm sure you'll find it hard
   to believe, but it was Fargo...
   He used to be such a nice man...
   What made him change...?

   Oh...
   He used to be such a nice man...
   What made him change...?

   HUH!? Why do you say that!?
   What's going on!?

   It's something the
   humans did, isn't it!?
   I'm sorry, but I need to be alone!

   Let's head home!
 
 [Explorer]
   Ancient lore reveals that
   the Dragonites knew of
   certain land formations
   they called Power Spots.
   There, they are said to
   have used the natural
   energy of the planet to
   generate Elements.
   
   Yo, Captain...!
   Can we go home now?
 
 [Explorer Captain]
   It appears that the altar
   at the back of this cave
   was made to house the
   Dragon Tear.
   But the strange thing is
   that there was only meant
   to be one Dragon Tear in
   this land...
   ...And yet the altar has
   two holding stands!
   I wonder what that
   could indicate?

   This place is
   unearthly!
  
   made to hold something.
 
   It seems that you
   cannot do it yet.

   thank you for your

   Everything is under

   Hey, don't wander
   around here.
   You are interfering
   with my duties.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Why Commander Norris.
   Thank you for your trouble.
   Currently,
   we have suspended all economic
   activities in Termina.
   We have left only the
   Element Shop alone, but that
   smith is a stubborn one... He will
   not close shop for anything.
   Of course, the bar over there
   has been shut down as well.
   We're pretty thorough when we
   need to be, you know.
   Not that anyone would
   want to go drinking in a

   just in case.

   all is well, sir!

   Don't bother me.

   Please stop that kid
   Serge!

   We're counting on you, sir!

   Arrgh, shoot!
   I gotta close shop before
   I've even sold anything!?
   What rotten luck!
   
   Just when I thought business
   was coming along...
   The Porre guys storm in,
   a kid named Serge attacks...
   it's a mess!

   Don't bother me, alright?
   Gotta hurry and clean up!
   I've got no time to waste
   around here!
 
 [Man]
   Just when I got all setup,
   I had to close up shop.
   Gosh, what's going on
   around here?
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   There are no suspicious
   ships, sir!

   I'm on watch for any
   suspicious ships.

   I-I'm scared!
   Where's that getaway boat!?

   Oh, Sir Lynx!

   he'd be such an evil man!
   I'll give him a taste of
   my masterful skills!

 [Girl]
   John...
   You are the most
   wonderful hero...
   
 [Hidden Person]
   Don't get me wrong.
   I'm not hiding because
   I'm scared or anything,
   alright?
   
 [Demi-human Man]
   Me work again.
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   These demi-humans are
   good workers.
   They really
   impressed me.

   Don't you be wandering
   around here.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   No suspicious ships
   to report, sir!

   Don't bother me.
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   All is well, sir.
   Too bad we couldn't see

   all the time, you know?
   So I wanted you to get
   well soon and come play
   with me...

 [Girl]
   Kein...
   Thank you.
   But even if I get well,
   I don't know if we'll ever
   play outside with the Porre
   soldiers out there.

 [Kein]
   Don't worry.
   They'll be leaving this town
   in no time!
   So come on and get well, OK?

 [Girl]
   OK! I'll practice my
   jump rope, too!
   
 [Mother]
   Kein brought you that Drakehorn
   soup, so you should drink up and
   get well soon!
   
 [Girl]
   Uh-huh!

 [Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   The place was deserted
   by the time we arrived.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   General Viper and the
   4 Devas have gone to
   Fort Dragonia.
   I have no further
   information.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   I kept the old dragon
   stable keeper to look
   after the dragons.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   I chased off the remaining
   dragoons, but some were
   imprisoned.
 
 [Stablekeeper]
   Is that you, Sir Lynx!?
   Ever since you left,
   the Porre military has
   occupied the manor.
   Can't you do anything
   about it!?
   
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No 
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   That over there is our
   ultimate weapon, Guillot.
   There's NO WAY you can
   defeat that thing.

 [Porre Soldier]
   Looks like the Viper Manor gang
   left in fear of our men.
 
 [Guillot]
   GA-GA-HYO...
   GA-PI-PI...
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   I came here looking
   for a fight,
   but with no one here,
   what's the point?
 
 [Riddel's Room, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Nurse]
   Miss Riddel has been taken
   to the basement prison
   against her will...
 
 [Viper's Room, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   I reckon there's a secret room
   around here somewhere...

   Whoa!
   So that's how you open it.
  
   
   ~~~Read it
   ~~~Don't read it

   Fear the one with the
   Missing shield...
   
   Repress the anger
   Of thy god...
   
   The moment you see truth
   From within the light...

   The god's anger will calm...

   There's something
   written on the back.

   Check the pillar
   in the armory!!!
 
 [Roof Terrace, Viper Manor (Another)]
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   A living flower...
   I hope it's not carnivorous.

   This flower...
   Seems to be a living creature...

   The flower...
   I-It's alive...!
   
   Hey?
   Where did that
   flower go?
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   It's been 100 years since
   people first inhabited El Nido...
   A lot has changed, but
   the sea remains the same.
   
 [Karsh's Room, Viper Manor (Another)]
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander Norris had another
   disagreement with his superiors
   and has been sent to the parlor
   on the other side.
 
 [ZOAH'S ROOM, VIPER MANOR (ANOTHER)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Nice and firm...
   But a bit smelly...
 
 [Vault, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   I was convinced the
   Frozen Flame would be
   here, but I was wrong.
 
 [Mess Hall, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander Norris disguised
   himself as a dishwasher to
   conduct espionage.

 [Porre Soldier]
   What the hell's takin' so long?
   Where's my food?
   That's the problem with El Nido
   people. They're too lazy!

 [Porre Soldier]
   Luccia used to work
   in a lab up in Porre.
   But she lost her brother
   in a freak accident
   during his experiments.
   She wanted to get away
   from it all, so she made
   her way down to El Nido.
   
   Our Grobyc is a killing
   machine being developed
   at that time.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   I kinda feel bad
   for Orcha.
   He doesn't know
   he's being used.

 [Porre Soldier]
   Whoa! Did you see that!?
   The cook, Orcha, just
   transformed into Hell's Cook!
   He probably has another
   dirty job to take care of...
 
 [Barracks, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander Norris is
   a little too soft.
   I wish he'd just crack down
   on those El Nido hicks.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   My orders are to investigate
   the sewer system.

   You can access the sewer
   system through a hatch
   in the hallway, but
   the current's too fast to
   actually set foot in the sewer.
   
   There's a valve that shuts off
   the water current, but the
   bridge leading to it is broken.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   I tried to wake him up,
   but he won't budge.
   Well, he's useless
   anyway.
 
 [Basement, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Under investigation, sir.

   I am sorry, Sir Lynx, but
   I cannot allow even you to pass.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Whoa!
   I didn't know you could
   get in from there!
 
   
 [Sign]
   <- Water Current Control Room
   Floodgate bridge under repair.

   Do not drop the barrel!
   It will clog the water system!
   
   trick to opening it.
   
   There's a valve.
   ~~~Tighten it
   ~~~Open it
   ~~~Leave it alone

   It won't tighten anymore.

   It won't open any further.
   
   '"Water Gate"'
   ~~~Read instructions
   ~~~Look at water gate
   ~~~Quit

   The valve is connected to
   the water gate. Open the
   valve to open the gate, and
   tighten it to close the gate.
 
 [Cells, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Man]
   Hey, man! Open up!
   
   Huh?

   Let me outta here!
   
   What the...?

   I'm innocent, I say!

   Hmm?
 

 [Porre Soldier]
   How did I end up in here!?
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Errrr...
   Didn't expect they'd
   come from behind me...
 
 [Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander Norris!
   I thought you were inside.

   What is to become of us?
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Please exit through the gate.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander!
   Is the meeting over?
   
   Please, by all means...
   Go on through, sir!
   
 [Stable, Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Stablekeeper]
   Those Porre soldiers
   are finally gone.
   Even the dragons are
   back safely.
   If only our master
   would return...
 
 [Barracks, Viper Manor (Another)]
   
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   Come back soon, everyone...
   Zzzz... Zzzz...
 
 [Riddel's Room, Viper Manor (Another)]

   Miss Riddel is safe!
   Thank goodness.
 
 [Viper Manor (Another)]
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander,
   will you be leaving?
   
   Sir Lynx,
   will you be leaving?
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander!
   Where are you going?
 
 [The Dragon's Tail, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Barkeep]
   Oh, when will those
   Porre guys ever leave...
 
 [Zappa's Smithy, Termina (Another)]
 
 [Apprentice]
   !!!
   Don't scare me.
   I thought you were
   a  Porre soldier!
 
 [Forbidden Island]
 
 [Demi-human]
   Those people were
   so annoying.
   They just came
   through like a storm.
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   I'm not sure it was
   a good idea to come
   with these people.
   Well, at least they know
   how to make a quick getaway.
   That's what saved me.
 
 [Marbule (Another)]
 
 [Demi-human Man]
   Yo!
   Are you guys outsiders?
   You better watch out for
   humans hunting down demi-humans.
   They'll rob you of your
   Elements if you're not
   careful.
 
 [Demi-human]
   Welcome to Marbule, the
   village of demi-humans.
   We warmly welcome all
   types of demi-humans here.

   Here, let me give you
   this as a welcome present!

   [Member] received the
   '"Valencian Cloth"' frame!
 
 [Demi-human]
   There's a Black Dragon
   residing here, but it's
   been asleep forever!

Bro of G's Shop:
   Come on, baby!
   Buy a heap load!
 
 [Demi-human Female]
   How's it goin'?
   Where are you guys from?
   Not many visitors come
   to these parts.
   Are you from the mainland?
   As you can see, there's
   not much here, but feel
   free to stay awhile.
   
Kid Bro of G's Shop:
   Yo, baby!
   Buy some of my
   stuff, too!

   ~~~Buy something
   ~~~Chat
   ~~~Leave

   Thanks, baby!!!

   I travel around a lot
   to find good stuff.
   Don't tell my bro, but
   I've got stuff he don't
   got, baby!

 [Demi-human Child]
   Who are you?
   Are you just
   passing through?
   Well, there's nothing
   here but me...
   There used to be a lot
   more of us here, but
   the humans have taken...
   I guess it doesn't
   concern you...
 
 [Water Dragon Isle (Another)]
 
 [Explorer]
   This was a while back, but I
   did a bad thing to another bunch
   like you, who just happened to
   be visiting the island at the time.

   Even though I did it to save my
   own sanity, it was a major mistake.
   I feel really bad about it...

   I just want to apologize.
   ...I wonder if they'll ever
   come back here again?
 
 [SS Invincible (Another)]
 
 [Pirate]
   Ly-Lynx!!!? Damn!
   The cap'n ain't here,
   so just leave!
   You lubber!
 
 [SS Invincible (Another)]
 
 [Pirate]
   LYNX!!!
   ...Not...
   The cap'n already told
   us about you.
   But no matter how ya
   look at it...
   You do look like Lynx.
 
 [Pirate]
   Oh yeah, the cap'n
   was lookin' for ya.
   I'll get in deep trouble
   if I let ya leave.
 
 [Pirate]
   Sorry ta hear about
   what happened, but...
   Just keep your distance, eh?
 
 [Mess Hall (SS Invincible)]
 
 [Pirate]
   Whoa!!!
   This dish is delicious!!!
   How is this possible?
   Has hell frozen over!?
 
 [Pirate]
   Whoa-wee!
   There's somethin' different
   about this fish...
   It's delicious!!!
 
 [Pirate]
   Hmmm...
   Maybe I should start thinkin'
   'bout becomin' a cook.
 
 [SS Invincible (Another)]
 
 [Pirate]
   Have you guys encountered
   a dragon before?
   They're said to be strong
   and fierce. Kinda like me...
   I guess...?
 
Riddel Groupie:
   S-She should be in here...

   AHHH!?
   Y-You scared me...
   Nice door knob, huh?
 
 [Bunks, SS Invincible (Another)]
  
 [Pirate]
   Well, ya know...
   I'm gettin' used to this.
   Viper and his people
   aren't all that bad, either.
 
 [Pirate]
   Everything will work out fine!!!
   That's my outlook on life.
   I'm sure there's a lot
   on your mind, but good luck.
   Tomorrow's a new day.
 
 [Pirate]
   Huaaah...
   You sleepy, too?
   ~~~No
   ~~~Yes...

   Oh...
   Well, I am...

   You can sleep here
   if you want...
   You have to sleep off
   yer fatigue...
 
 [Pirate]
   The other day during
   my watch duty,
   I saw this big, huge bug
   fly over from '"Hydra Marshes."'
   I think it was headin' towards
   '"Gaea's Navel."'
   It's surrounded by bluffs
   and inaccessible by sea.
 
 [Hydra Marshes (Another)]
 
Captain:
   All of a sudden, the ground
   collapsed. Plus, there's a
   strange odor coming from the hole...
   Judging from my experience,
   this may be something we
   should avoid altogether...
   I advise you not to go down.
   
   ~~~Go for it!
   ~~~Nah, too dangerous
 
 [SS Zelbess (Home)]
 
 [Man]
   I'm gettin' kinda bored
   of having nothing to do...
   I never knew being bored
   could be so boring.
   I wish Nikki's concert
   would start soon...
   Or else I'll die of
   boredom!
 
 [Man]
   Where did that demi-
   human waitress go?
   I'm thirsty as hell!
 
 [Roadie]
   Nikki has told me
   all about you guys.
   Hop on!
   ~~~Hop on
   ~~~Forget it
 
 [Magical Dreamers Ship (Home)]
 
 [Demi-human Woman]
   It's hard to get back
   into the groove...
 
 [Demi-human]
   I never thought
   I would be able to
   play this again...
 
 [Demi-human Man]
   We have to make sure
   we get the rhythm right...
 
 [Demi-human]
   There's no way I'm goin'
   back to that dark,
   dingy room after this...
   It feels great out here!
   
Sage:
   The rest is up to you...
   
 [Yu & Mi]
   I wonder what
   happened to Miki...?
   
   She's probably somewhere
   in deep thought by herself...
   She always gets like that
   after a show, remember?
 
 [Roadie]
   The concert was
   a success!!!
   Thanks to you guys,
   of course!
   I'm giving the band
   members some time off.
   They must be quite tired...
 
 [Restaurant, SS Zelbess (Home)]
 
 [Man]
   I was really blown away
   by Nikki's performance...
   He's a genius...
   No, that still doesn't
   give him enough credit.
   He must have gone through
   a lot in life to come up
   with a performance like that...
 
 [Woman]
   Oh...Nikki...
   That was a beautiful
   performance...
   You moved me
   to tears...!
 
 [Woman]
   Nikki's concert was more like
   a broadway musical this time.
   It was wonderful...
   How does he come up
   with these ideas!?
   Well, I'll be able to
   enjoy my daily latte now!

 [Inn, SS Zelbess (Home)]
 
 [Note]
   Taking care of other business.
   Please feel free to stay.
   ~~~Stay
   ~~~Forget it

 [SS Zelbess (Home)]
 
 [Woman]
   The long-awaited Nikki
   concert is over...
   It felt like an eternity
   waiting for the concert
   to start, but once it started,
   it ended before I knew it.
   There was something
   bothering Nikki, though...
   He looked a little sad...
   but that really brought
   out his charm!
   Anyway, now that the concert's
   over, how am I going to fill
   this void in my life?
   Ohh, Nikki...!
   Marry me!!!
 
 [Man]
   Have you guys been to
   an island called Marbule?
   It used to be a beautiful
   island where mermaids lived.
   But now, it's infested by
   nasty-lookin' monsters.
   That island will never
   be the same...
 
 [Woman]
   Hey! You're my ultimate
   rival, Miki!
   Listen, YOU!
   You stay away from
   my Nikki, or you'll
   be sorry!
   
   OH MY GAWD!!!
   Nikki!!!!!!
 
 [Viper Manor (Home)]
 
 [Man]
   Move it!
   Move it!

   Oh, my achin' back...
 
 [Man]
   Yeah...
   I guess this will do.
 
 [Acacia Dragoon]
   How's this...?
 
 [Una]
   Alright!

   I wish it'll be done soon.

    The interior is still
    under construction.
    
 [Man]
   Hold that for me, will ya?
 
 [Boy]
   I had them finish the
   sand box first.
   
   Hello, Headmaster!
   
 [Girl]
   Some swings would be nice, too.
   
   Please, Headmaster!?
 
 [Man]
   Darn...
   We need more manpower.
 
 [Stablekeeper]
   Is the dragon stable ready yet?
   
 [Earth Dragon Isle (Home)]
 
 [Explorer]
   The captain told me our next
   exploration site would be safer,
   without any threat of monsters.
   But look at this place...
   All you got here is a heap of sand,
   rocks, and all the time in the world!
   Perhaps there would've been more
   excitement if I had joined the
   Marbule team...
   
   Investigate... Search... Investigate...
   Why the heck did I choose this profession?
   I guess the exciting life of an
   explorer is just in the movies...
 
 [Explorer]
   Boy, is it hot...!
   Why the hell do we have to
   explore a desert island...?

   We've already conducted a
   thorough search of this island.
   I wish the captain would call
   it quits already...
 
 [Explorer]
   Did you just come here out of
   curiosity? Then I guess you're
   one of us! Hah hahaha...!

   Don't tell me you're here seeking
   the '"Powers of the Sleeping Dragon?"'
   You really believe in that stuff?
   Actually, this place is known as
   '"Earth Dragon Isle,"' but as you
   can see, there's nothing but sand.

   Just like my buddy was saying,
   nothing but sand and rocks.
   Oh, and watch out for the
   quicksand in the middle.
 
 [Explorer]
   Whoa!
   You're alive!?
   I thought you were
   dead meat for sure!
 
 [Explorer]
   Huh? What...?
   ...The quicksand is the entrance,
   and the sand boil shoots you
   back up to ground level...?

   Are you serious!?
   How the heck were we
   supposed to find that out!?
   What were we supposed to do?
   Just jump in the quicksand
   and pray for our lives!?
   That's the problem with you
   amateurs...! You're too rash!
   (Damn... Shown up by amateurs...)
  
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No
 
 [Explorer]
   I hate having to go through
   the quicksand to get here...
   Everytime you go down, you
   get sand in your mouth...

   When you want to get back
   above ground, just jump
   into that sand boil.
   It'll shoot you right back up.
   It's quite a rush going
   through that thing.
   But just watch out you don't
   sprain your ankle when you land.
   
   ...Oh, wait a minute...
   You guys already knew that.
   But seriously, I just hate
   going through that quicksand...
 
 [Explorer]
   Whoa! You scared me!
   Don't creep up on me like that. I'm
   studying this thing's behavior right now.
   So just keep quiet and don't bother me!
   Unless you want to hear the
   result from my observations?
   ~~~No, thank you
   ~~~Yes, please!

   You interrupt my study, and then you
   don't want to hear the results...
   You suck!
   Just go away and don't bother me.
   
   You got it!
   It's a long report, though.
   Hey...! Don't leave!

   That thing's been walking back and
   forth, back and forth...
   It may be slow, but I'm not
   stupid enough to fight it!
   I threw a rock at it, and it just
   clammed up inside its shell.
   Maybe you can push it over the
   cliff while it's in that form?

   Sometimes, it just stands
   there, right by the cliff.
   That's when you want
   to push it over...
   But the problem is, who's going
   to stand tall and fight that thing?
   
   Well, that's about it for my report.
   In conclusion, I would like to say,
   '"Attack it right by the cliff."'
   Good luck if you go for it!
 
   You guys are a lot
   stronger than you look.
   Well, I guess that
   concludes my study...
   
 [Explorer]
   Maybe if the three sand jets
   combine their forces into one spot...
   It could create one powerful, sand boil...?
   That's just my theory, but I still
   need to think of a way to fill
   up the sand jets...
   
   Looks like my theory was correct.
   If only I had defeated those
   things, I could've had full
   bragging rights!
 
   jet to stop the flow.
 
   to stop the sand jet.

 [Demi-human]
   Th-The Black Dragon...
   I-It's awake...
 
 [Demi-human Man]
   The Black Dragon has
   awakened...?
   I can't believe it...

 [Demi-human]
   I can't believe the Black
   Dragon has awakened...

 [Witch Doctor's House, Marbule (Another)]
 
Witch Doctor:
   The Black Dragon
   has awakened!
   I can't believe it,
   after all these years,
   the dragon is finally awake!
   How did this happen!?
   
 [Sage's House, Marbule (Another)]
 
Ruling Elder:
   The Black Dragon has awakened...
   Even without our song...
   What could have happened...?
   
Ruling Elder:
   ......
   You are distrupting the peace
   in our village. Please leave.
 
 [Marbule (Another)]
 
 [Demi-human]
   A-Ahhh!!!
   D-Don't kill me!!!
 
 [Demi-human]
   ......
   .........
 
 [Demi-human]
   What in Marbule's name
   is going on...?
 
 [Demi-human]
   Hey, you!!!
   W-What have you done
   to the Black Dragon!?
 
 [Demi-human Woman]
   ......
 
 [Demi-human]
   I can't believe it...
   A human has defeated
   the Black Dragon!
 
 [Demi-human]
   I can't believe you
   guys defeated the
   Black Dragon!
 
 [Demi-human Man]
   A-Ahhh!!!
   Not me, too!?
   H-Help!!!
 
 [Demi-human Man]
   W-Who are you guys...?
 
 [Witch Doctor's House, Marbule (Another)]
 
Witch Doctor:
   Unbelievable!
   You pacified
   the Black Dragon!?
   I just can't believe it...
   If this is true, then you...
   Ah, NEVERMIND!
   I don't believe you!
   
 [Sky Dragon Isle (Another)]
 
 [Explorer Captain]
   Something seems to be
   strange up there.
   Uh, no, I'm not going, but
   you can go check for yourself.
   Hahahaha... cold sweat.
 
 [Explorer]
   The locals are making a big
   clamor, saying that the
   Sky Dragon has come back.
 
 [Explorer]
   The locals are making a big
   clamor, saying that the
   Sky Dragon has flown away.
 
 [Explorer Captain]
   Umph.
   Seems like the Sky Dragon
   has left this island.
 
 [Forbidden Island (Home)]
 
 [Woman]
   Will that man
   ever return...?

   I shall wait...
 
 [Marbule (Another)]
 
 [Frightened Girl]
   I can't hear the
   dragon's cry anymore.
   Another one...gone...

   I heard the Black
   Dragon's cry.
   Is it really awake?
 
 [Witch Doctor]
   Witch Doctor:
   ......
   Hmmm, interesting.
   So you say your
   true self is human?
   I can't do anything
   about your curse.
   Away with you, human.
 
 [Bro of G]
   Hi, just passin' through?
   You should rest up a bit.
 
 [Kiki's House, Arni (Home)]
 
 [Kiki's Dad]
   Just between you and me,
   I've been hearing voices.
   You know, inside my head...
   Something about praying to

 [Explorer]
   Have you guys ever heard of
   '"Gaea's Navel?"'
   It's a remote island surrounded by
   bluffs at the southern tip of El Nido.
   No one's ever set foot on that
   island before.
   We explorers even go as far as
   calling that place, the '"Holy Ground."'

   From our extensive research, we've
   discovered that a '"huge bug"' comes
   flying into this forest from there.
   The only problem is, how do we get
   a hold of that bug...?
   We don't wanna get eaten, you know?
   If only there was a way to tame it...
 
 [Explorer]
   You'll find weird, yellow
   monsters in this forest which
   don't take too kindly to humans.
   Just between us, I think they
   know something about that '"huge
   bug"' you just heard about.

   I wish I could beat the information
   out of those yellow monsters, but
   they fight in large numbers.
   Well, l must admit, I'm not very
   strong, either...
   Anyway, my explorer instincts tell
   me they definitely know something!

   We have orders not
   to let anyone through.
   But I believe we will be
   withdrawing soon.
   
 [Porre Soldier]
   We haven't received
   official word, but there
   seems to have been some
   trouble inside.
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   Commander!?
   When did you get out?
 
 [Porre Soldier]
   This place is closed down.
 
 [Termina (Another)]

 [Man]
   Y-You are...!
   Gosh, I was really
   surprised to hear about
   what happened to you.
   Although you might have
   some hard times, don't
   give up! I'll be rooting
   for you.
   Oh yeah, I'm closing up shop
   today, so go ahead and
   take any of the leftovers.
   That'll cheer you up!

   You've received some
   Viper Churros...
   They taste better than usual...
   You feel revitalized!

   There was something
   hard inside it...
   When you look at it closer, you found
   Rainbow!!!
 
 [Man]
   Serge...!?
   ...But you're not the same

   Welcome to Marbule!!!
   The village filled with
   love and happiness!

   Actually, we're still
   working on it.
   But I'm sure we'll become
   the most love-filled
   village in the world!
   You wanna know why?
   Because for the first time ever,
   we've come to an understanding
   with humans, and we're working
   together to rebuild this place.
   That goes to show,
   nothing is impossible!
   I'm so psyched!
    
   Welcome!
   And...
   Congratulations!!!
   You're the 100th visitor to
   Marbule, the village filled

   a common goal.

   Argh!
   What a lucky guy,
   that stud-muffin...
 
 [Demi-human]
   OHH YEAH!
   I never knew work
   could be so satisfying
   to the body and soul!

 [Demi-human]
   This village is going
   to be fabulous!
   Ohhh, it feels like
   love is in the air...!

 [Demi-human Child]
   Whoo-hoo!
   I like this place.
   I'm making this my home!

   Let's see... I'll make this a
   sunroof and lighten it up.
   Then we can all live here happily!

   This doctor is great, man!
   He took a look at my cut
   just a second ago, and
   now it's completely healed!
   Watch out for that
   assistant guy, though.
   He tried to give me
   the wrong medication.
 
   ~~~Yes
   ~~~No

Witch Doctor:
   Thank you.

Witch Doctor:
   I'm glad this room
   was left as is.

Witch Doctor:
   Excuse me, but you're
   a friend of Irenes,
   aren't you?
   Can I ask you a favor?
   Would you give this to
   Irenes for me?
   Her parents entrusted
   this to me years ago.
   I believe the time is right
   for Irenes to have it.
   Just remember: it was not
   meant to harm others.
   
   a package for Irenes.

Witch Doctor:
   Thank you.

   With my earnings, I plan

   Stop by for my grand

   Hey...
   You're short...

   It was saying something about
   going to the Hermit's Hideaway.
   
   Yo, did you find your
   own ship?
   
   Here, this'll cheer you up!
   
   If you ever see him,
   give him this for me.

   Hmmm...
   This fits you exactly.

   Hey, you're that guy from

   Thanks to you, that skeleton
   thingy hasn't reappeared in
   my dreams and, I'm able to
   sleep well!

   Oops... Ahh, give me a break.
   It's been hard on me, ever since
   I picked up that bone from this
   dried up waterfall...
   It came into my dreams every night...
   EVERY NIGHT... So, um, I, uh, felt
   bad that I forced it on you.
   No, uh, really, from my heart!
   So, uh, forgive me, will you?
   Here, I'll give you this.
   No, no, it's alright.
   This time it's not haunted!
   It's a material called '"Rainbow."'
   You can't find this very easily!
   Take it as a token of my appreciation.

   [Member] received
   Rainbow.
   
   Combining the Rainbow with a certain
   material is supposed to produce some
   awesome weapons and armor, but...
   They say that no ordinary tool or
   blacksmith can forge such a thing,
   though.

   This story isn't related to my specialty,
   so I don't know much about it.
   Even though it's rare, the Rainbow
   wouldn't be of any use to me.

   Nothing can be gained from conflict.

 [Fairy]
   In no era have we ever been
   free of conflict.
   Beings born on the same planet,
   hating and hurting each other...
   Why are we so incomplete?
   Why do we not live hand in hand?
   It's too hard for me to understand...

   Like I told you,
   they're all taking shelter
   at the village chief's.

   high command ever
   anticipated such a

   around here and BLAM!
   You get something as crazy as that...

   first settlers of mankind.

   It's a dead end.

   Maybe some kind of dragon
   treasure will open it up?
   
   Do you remember where
   that treasure was?

   Haven't seen you around.
   What have you been up to?
   
   WHAT!?
   Another me...!?
   And I wasn't a fisherman?
   And you really met this guy?
   You can't be serious?
   Sounds like a dream to me.
   Hmmm... Another me, living
   a different life...

   I see...
   So you showed him my
   shark tooth amulet...
   I definitely don't want to
   know what the me in the

   With such a bizarre thing occuring,
   like the Sky Dragon's island floating
   in the sky, I'm afraid of what's
   going to happen next...

   All that I hope for is
   a world where my children
   can live worry-free.
   

Macha:
I'm a little worried about
the two of you going alone.
I'll come along with you two.
Ah, don't worry about my son.
He'll be fine on his own for
a while.

Doc:
I will do what I can.
You dudes go do whatever
you can for her.
To be perfectly honest, without
the antidote, her chances of
survival are close to zilch.
But we cannot give up hope
without a fight.

Doc:
I cannot promise you
anything more than that.
...Forgive me.

Don'tCHA be sayin' you
have no idea!

Hey, Serge..

Radius:

even the locals avoid...
I pray for our safety.

Harle:
Look, Serge.
Ze village where you were born...
Ze people you grew up wit'...
But it'z not ze same...
See, I told you.
Nobody carez about
what'z inside.
People only see what
zey want to see and
only believe what zey
want to believe...

Harle:
Réalité iz merely
a dream zat all
of us share.
Ze dream itself may
differ, but everyone
still clingz to it.
Even so, would you like
to go on living az Serge?
Do you t'ink you can...?
Well, Serge?

Oh, it's you, Serge.
So you wanna go to
Water Dragon Isle?
Perhaps you should
go ask the old guy
by the pier?
He doesn't seem too
busy. I'm sure he'll
be willing to help you.

Please, I have no
time for games.

What is it?
Something interesting...?
Oh, I can't...!
I can't accept
anything from you.
Who knows what
people would say.


I wonder if those soldiers
are back at work digging
that hole now that
the rains have subsided?
I don't know what
they're up to, but it seems
like soldiers are digging
up all of Fossil Valley.
I can't figure out
what they're thinking.
Why would they want to
dig up a place like that?

Radius:
Oh, it's you, Serge.
Feel free to call upon
me for anything.
Looks like I will be
able to find '"my place."'
Ohhh, the excitement...!

Gonji:
Hello there, Serge.
Long time no see.
I hope you're keeping
up with your studies.
That's if you want
to become a fine
adult like me!

Gonji:
I've been asked to fill
in as village chief while
Chief Radius is gone.
It's strange, but I get
the feeling I've done
this before...
Hmmm...

Very strange...

only to face such a result...?

...Dude, what are you
stressing about?
Your own strength,
or the unavoidable reality?

Doc:
I don't know who you are, but
how would you know how I feel?
You don't know me...

Doc:
...I understand.
I understand so much it hurts,
because you are the other me...

Doc:
!? What is going on...?
Who are you, dude?
Can you really be me?

Doc:
Death is the total wipeout.
All life must face death
eventually...
There is no escaping it.
But, because life has limits,
we can live strongly to the
very end.
Is that not right, dude?

Doc:
Yes...I know that.
That is something I knew
from the beginning...

Doc:
As gnarly as it seems,
this is reality.
Let me just say that
there are many
alternate worlds...
Even in different worlds,
you are you, and I am me.
Just remember that. Take care
of the other doctor for me...

Don't worry about such
trivial things.
There ain't no use thinkin'
up an explanation anyway!

Korcha:
...Do you really think it's trivial?
But I have to agree that there's
no way of explainin' this.

Don't worry, don't worry.
Let's try not to use our heads
beyond our limited capacities!

Korcha:
...I don't think that's somethin'
you should be sayin' to yourself.
Oh, never mind...

Korcha:
Yo, Serge.
Nobody's called me lately,
so it's been very relaxin'!
Oh yeah, I've gotta give these
back to you before I forget.
They're the Elements that
Mel stole a while back.
I gave her a good scoldin' for it!
It's just childish mischief, so
give her a break, OK?

Korcha:
Yo, Serge..
Nobody's called me lately,
so it's been very relaxin'!
And take it easy with that
boat I lentCHA.
Don't forget, it's my
favorite boat, you hear?

Korcha:
Didja need something today?
~~~Not really
~~~Come and join me

Korcha:
Ah, man, you're leavin' me
behind again? My ma makes me
do a lotta chores when I'm here.
You guys have my boat, so I
can't leave the village, either...
C'mon, Serge., do me a favor
and take me with you next time,
alright?

Korcha:
Good timing.
I've been bored to death!
Time to hit the open seas again!

Korcha:
...Left behind again.
Don'tCHA think that's
a bit cruel?

Korcha:
Huh? Who are you guys?
I've never seen you before,
are you ma's friends?
Oh, I don't care.
Sorry, but I'm not in a
mood to talk to strangers.
Could ya leave me alone?

~Korcha joinedCHA party!

Korcha:
You are...Serge.?
You survived...

Korcha:
...Sorry.
I don't know if I should be
rejoicin' or panickin' right now.
My head's still screwed from
tryin' to sort out what
happened back there.
You are who you say, but...
I just can't figure it all out yet.

Korcha:
Wh-Who are you!?
Huh? You say you're Serge.?
Are you crazy?
That guy was human.
No matter how I look at you,
you're a demi-human.
That's a terrible joke,
if you're tryin' to be funny..

Korcha's, ma:
Oh my, who are you?
You're an interesting visitor.
Are you here to see my son?
He's upstairs if you need him.
There isn't much here,
but feel right at home.

Macha:
You are alright, Serge..
I'm sorry I wasn't of any help
to you...
But I am relieved to see you
alive and well.
Unfortunately, I have lost
my cool.
I don't think I'll be of any use
like this...so I can't help you
out yet. I'm so sorry.

Macha:
Wh-Who are you!?
Huh, Serge. you say?
Don't be ridiculous!
Keep such foolish jokes to
yourself!
If you've got time to be playing
around, go find some work to do!
Gosh, you must be drunk or
something...

Mel:
Hey, hey, Serge..
Take me with you!
I'll be much more useful than
my big brother! I'm not kiddin'!
It'll be OK, I swear.
Pleeease.

Mel:
Huh?
You're not with blondie
today, Sergey?

Mel:
Mel doesn't have a
catman as her friend.
Are you here to see big brother?
Big brother should be upstairs.
...But it's the first time I've
seen a catman.
Didja come from the mainland?

Mel:
Mel returned all of the
Elements to my big brother,
so don't be mad at me.

Mel:
...Oh, rats.
Mel has to stay behind?
That's no fun!

Mel:
...Oh, rats.
Mel has to stay behind?
That's no fun!

Mel:
...Oh!?
You're...alive.
It's a good thing...right?
Whoops...
Mel can't tell what's
right or wrong right now.
I know you're still Serge.,
even if your body's different,
but...
Sorry, Serge..
I'm still too confused...
I haven't been able to
sort out my feelings yet...

Mel:
Hey! You're not supposed to
come into other people's houses!
Isn't that common sense?
Huh? Serge.?
...Are you alright, Mr. Catman?
Mel's friend Serge., is
human!!!
Don't go tryin' to tell jokes
that aren't even funny.
You should try to be a little
more honest, too.
Bye-bye, Mr. Catman.

Mel:
Oh, blondie!
Um, I have somethin' that I
wanted to discuss with you...

Kid:
...Huh?
Ya need to talk to me?
Go ahead, speak up.

Mel:
Umm, Mel would like
to speak to you in
private if possible...

Kid:
Sure, whatever.
That's fine with me.

Kid:
...So, what didja want
to talk to me about?

Mel:
Actually,000 I,000 um000...000...
...000...
...000...

Kid:
Sure, you got it!
This problem was drivin'
me up the wall, too!
Mel, I understand yer
feelings reeeeal well!
'"Don'tCHA worry."'
I won't get in yer way.

Mel:
Thank you, Kid!
Then please take
Mel with you!

Korcha:
...Hey, whatCHA talkin' about?
Come on and tell us, too.

Kid:
No way. This is strictly a
woman to woman thing!
Sorry, but I ain't gonna tell ya.

Korcha:
Huh?  WhatCHA mean by that?
Nevermind that, it's gonna get
noisy with Mel joinin' us...

~Mel joinedCHA your party!

Mel:
Oh, and Kid!
Take this as a token of
our promise.
It's a special frame
made in Guldove called,
'"Guldovian Stitch."'
It's got a cool lookin' pattern
so I'm sure you'll like it!

Kid received the
'"Guldovian Stitch"' frame!

Steena:
The power of the ancient
Dragon Gods shall guide
you to the Sea of Eden...

Steena:
May the lost Goddess of Fate
bless the children of the
planet...

Doc:
Dragonians and dragon lore...
It all sounded like fiction
to someone like me from the
mainland.
That is, until something like that
occured in front of my eyes...
I still want to believe that
it was all just a bad dream...
It will take time to fully accept
it all as a reality...
I am sorry, Serge..
I cannot rejoin you just yet.

Doc:
Try not to take too many risks.
One can only live strongly
because life is limited!

Doc:
It has been a long time
since that incident.
From your story, I can tell that
you were able to meet her...
But it seems you have not heard
the details of what happened.
Perhaps it is in our best
interest that I tell you
how she was saved.

Doc:
Shortly after you left, a young
traveler who happened to have
Hydra Humour visited the village.
Thanks to him, we were able
to save her life...
A few days after the poison
was completely neutralized,
she left for the main island.
Her destination was
Fort Dragonia...
and that is where you
saw her again.

Doc:
But now, her whereabouts
are unknown again...
I must say, your travels are
far from trouble-free, dude.

Doc:
It has been a while
since I saw you last.
Were you able to meet her?

Doc:
So you were able to find her...
I am glad to hear that.
I must apologize for my
conduct back then.
My shortcomings as a doctor
has caused you much trouble.


Doc:
   I know the Dragon Tear
   changed Serge into this
   form at Fort Dragonia, but...
   I saw it happen with my
   own eyes, and I still
   cannot believe it...

Along with the dwarves, you'll
find other monsters in this forest.
I know you think you're strong and
all, but just don't wander off too far!

Razzly:
I really wish I could go
back to my home island soon...
I wonder how everyone's doing?

Razzly:
So the Dragon Tear
changed Serge. into
your current form...?
I'm fairy sorry, Serge..
I'm so confused right now,
I can't be of much help.
But one of these days...

Razzly:
Huh!? Who are you!?
What!? Serge....!?
You shouldn't tell lies.
Serge. is human.
You look nothing like him!
Tee-hee!
Take care, Mr. Demi-human!

Don't worry.
They're all very
understandin'.
Oh, and the ones who ran
off are back onboard.
Pay them a visit when
you get a chance.

Fargo:
   NO!!!
   There's no escape!

Fargo:
   You ready!?
   ~~~All set!
   ~~~Just a minute!
Fargo:
So you're all talk, eh!?
Arg! Stick these land-

Fargo:
I thought you would've
put up a better fight...
Arg! Stick these land-
lubbers in the hold!

Fargo:
Huh? What?

Fargo:
Well, then...

I didn't think we'd
end up in the same ship.
Well, you never know what
to expect in life.

Ahoy, mateys!
Where's that lively,
young blondie?
What!?
She's in a coma!?
Th-That's terrible!
What the hell are ya
doin' here!?
You should be by her side!

Show some respect
to Cap'n Fargo!

No use hiding it!
So you're tryin' ta track
down information, eh?
Here's a little tip.
People need fire
to survive.
So, if ya see any smoke
puffin' out from somewhere,
go check it out.

I can't be of much help,
but good luck to ya.

Ho ho ho and
a bottle of rum!

If only we had a good
relish to go with it.

Orcha:
Don'tCHA know you can't
fight when you're hungry?

Orcha:
Looks like this is it...
You'll do fine!
You've been eatin' my food,
haven'tCHA!?
CHA-HA-HA-HA!
Arg...!
With so many people onboard,
we're stuck in here!

The other day during
my watch duty,
I sprained my ankle and
couldn't run anymore.
That really sucked.
You gotta take care
of that real quick.

We're packed like
sardines in here!
And it's all because of them!
But...
Riddel and Marcy
can stay.
Everyone else, leave!

Nikki:
Oh...
It's...nothing...

Nikki:
Mind if I ask
you something...?

Nikki:
It's about the other world...
Is Zelbess...?

Nikki:
Hm?
Oh...
Yeah, sure.

Nikki:
......
Rockin'.
It'd be nice to
have more people
listen to my songs.

Nikki:
Including Marcy.

Nikki:
Oh, and one more thing...

Nikki:
If you didn't call this ship
the S.S. Invincible...
What would you have called it?
The same name the other you
called it in the other world?

Nikki:
'"Who knows."'

Nikki:
(Hah-hah!)

How vast and deep it is...

Fargo:
When I'm through with
everythin' here...
I'm thinkin' about settin' sail
to other parts of the world.
What do ya think about
comin' along?

Fargo:
Yeah...
She's dead...

Fargo:
What?

Fargo:
Who knows.

Fargo:
(Har-har!)

All:
Aye-aye, Cap'n!!!
SS Invincible

Fargo:
Keep it up, Serge!!!
It's comin'!s Kid?
Has she snapped out of it yet?

Karsh:
Yo, what up, Serge.!
What am I doin',
you ask?
I'm here by Lady Riddel's
side, protectin' her from
scum...
I'm her personal bodygua...
Ahhh...nothing!

Never in my life did I
expect to encounter a
real ghost ship!
Gah-haha-ha!

Riddel Groupie:
Damn!
I-I-I can't get close to her.

Fargo:
Listen up.
I've explained yer
situation to me men.
Don't worry. They're all
very understandin'.
Oh, and the ones who ran
off are back onboard.
Pay them a visit when
you get a chance.

Fargo:
Ahoy, mateys!
Make yerselves at home.

Fargo:
I've got a bad feelin' 'bout this...
Let's just get it over with.

Pleaze, Serge.
Turn back now.

Harle:
She iz not'ing

She will bring
not'ing but misfortune
to your life.

Old Man:
Actually, I see that you are not.
It must have been that munchkin
that just flew away.

Old Man:
Miss Riddel had informed me
that Lynx and the general
were heading to Fort Dragonia.
I played it safe and went
into hiding for a while...
And it looks like Lynx did
pay me a visit.
I'm sure the general has
no idea what happened here.
Lynx is the one behind all this.

Old Man:
I had a feeling
something like this
might happen...
That is why I made
sure to build a sturdy
stronghold underground.
I believe it should
still be intact.

Old Man:
Are you here to
ask me questions?
Come, there's no
need to be shy.

Radius:
It's you, Serge..
What is it today?

Radius:
Don't you have more
important things to do?

Radius:
Is she awake!?
Oh, thank goodness...
Thank goodness...

The Chrono Cross begins to shimmer.

w.a.itsuffixe, Serge.!

Harle:

Radius:
Where are you going?
We must stay put for now.

O, thou son of man,
bound by the Goddess of Fate...
Welcome to this land.
The time has cometh to
unleash the powers of the
Sleeping Dragons, yet...
Thou must again cross
dimensions to accomplish
one last errand.

Water Dragon:
So sad it may be that
this is also the destiny of one
bounded by fate...

It's rusted and won't open...
So, what'd you think?

Be my guest.

Now that the captain's
gone, what are we
supposed to do?
Maybe we should lend our
hands to the restoration
of Marbule...?

Damn demi-humans...!
They got away, right
under our noses!
We have to do somethin'
before the captain finds out...

Oh, a Nikki otaku!
You look just like him!

008Sigh...000
The concert's over...
I was a bit disappointed that he
didn't play any of his old stuff...
But at least I was able
to see Nikki live!

Oh...Nikki...
Why is it that you always
feel so far away from me...?
Strangely, though, you feel
very close today...

Oh...Nikki...
Why are you feeling so
melancholy today...?
Can't you see I'm here
for you? Oh...Nikki...!

Tch!
What the hell was that
concert all about!?
I thought it was supposed
to be a head-bangin' gig!?
What a letdown!

So you're Nikki...!
Wow... You're the man!
Your performance really
brought back fond memories
of my mother...
008Sniff...000
Time to go home...

Sneff:
You had me worried sick...!!!
I had to lie down a bit
because I strained
my back running...

Sneff:
You had me worried...!!!
I had to lie down a bit
because I strained my back
running...
I'm sorry, ffolks.
Actually, there's absolutely
no trick behind that magic.
An old troll gave me a
mysterious berry during
my travels, long ago.
She was saying someffing
about the Bend of Time...
Anyway, affter I ate the berry,
I was able to transfform people
into cats.
I wish I could change you
back to your human fform,
but my achin' back...
I'll need to lie down a bit,
so you'll have to stay that
way ffor a while.
I hope you understand...

Zzzz... Zzzz...
Zzzz... Zzzz...

I gotta give it to him...
Pops still has it,
even at his age.
Don't know when he'll start
feeling better, though...
Don't worry about it.
I'll be sure to feed you.

We have to get
the timing down!

Pops traveled the world
on his skills alone.
He really does deserve
more respect...

But Pops has that
'"you know what..."'

Oh yeah...
If only he didn't have
that '"you know what..."'

We're gonna shake it!

Actually, old man Sneff has
a considerably considerable
amount of debt to Captain Fargo.
That is precisely why he
cannot leave this ship.

W-We're gonna do our best
to shake laughter out of
as many people as we can!

Old man Sneff is always
shakin' it into debt
with his gambling...
Gambling is about the
only joy in his life.
I-It's kinda sad...

Sorry, folks.
Just hang in there.

Well, I guess we're up!
We have to fill in for
Pops, too!!!

Sneff:
I'm really sorry, ffolks...
I just need to lie
down ffor a bit.
You'll have to play
cat and mouse ffor a while...

Sneff:
Contrary to my liffestyle now,
I used to travel the
world perfforming magic
when I was young.
The sensation off amazing
an audience wiff my
perfformance...
Wiff the audiences eyes ffixed
right on me, you could almost
cut the tension wiff a kniffe...
I ffelt as though I could hear
every one of them, swallowing
in anticipation...
It takes me back to the
good ol' days just by
closing my eyes...

Sneff:
Sorry, I'm sure I must be
boring you wiff my past...
But I tell you, it is so
great to be young.
There are inffinite possibilities.
Well anyway, 10 shows per day
is taking a toll on my old body.
I'm really tired, so I'm gonna
hit the sack.
Don't go wandering outside
looking like that.
I don't wanna be held responsible
should anyffing happen to you.
I am lanky Lank!

A-And...
I'm Stout!

Shake it!!!

...And enjoy our show!!!

Sneff:
How about we start offf wiff
my '"Cat on a Hot Tin Rooff,"'
today!?
Do I have a volunteer
ffrom the audience?

Ladies and gentlemen,
a knife show,
by '"Fat and Slim!"'

Oh, you seem excited.

H-Hey!

I thought they were a joke
at first, but you start
liking them after a while!

Ohhh!

That was fun!
I like this place!

Fargo:
I don't know what
your scheme is, but
it doesn't concern me.
It's in your hands now...

Fargo:
Viper...
You're still alive!!!?

Viper:
Fargo...
Nothing will ever change if
you do not face up to reality.

Fargo:
......

Fargo:
Nikki...
Your ship has
already departed.
What's on your mind?

Fargo:
Hasn't the concert
started yet, Nikki?
The crowd is waiting anxiously.
Stop worrying about
trivial matters and
get on with the show.

Nikki:
......

Fargo:
Luccia...
If what Irenes says
is true, then I have
misunderstood you.

Luccia:
yes...
I do not blame you.
All you can do now is
gently embrace your
daughter, Marcy.

Fargo:
Yes...

Fargo:
Marcy?
So, you're Marcy...!?
Hahhahah...
You have your mother's eyes!

Marcy:
......
Like...who are you?
And how do you know
my mom?

Fargo:
I can't say now, but
you'll find out eventually.

Marcy:
......
There's somethin'
fishy about you!
The gamblers dont come back after you lose!
You cats wouldn't understand
the pleasure of gambling...

Not bad, guys!
You must be pretty lucky to
beat the captain like that!
Huh?
Luck is a big part of skill?
Heheh, you're probably right!
You crack me up...

You have no chance of
winnin' against the captain.
He's never lost a game.

I can't believe the
captain lost...

I can't imagine the captain
pulling a scam...
But it makes you wonder
with his winning record.

I thought I would be
the first to beat the
captain...
Good job, guys...
008(Listen...uhhh...
 So what's the secret
 to beating him? Huh?
 Tell me...please?)000

I'm really glad the captain
cleared my debt today.
It was getting out of hand.
Be careful and keep your
head above water.
Or else you'll end up like
old man Sneff here.

Nikki:
That was a rockin' jam session!
It'd be great if we could
tour together some time!

Nikki:
Yeah...!

Nikki:
......!?
Another me...?
Hey, I'd love to jam
with you some time...!
How 'bout it!?

Nikki:
Sure, that'd be great...!
You know our mother's song,
right? Teach it to me?

Nikki:
Sure thing...!

Nikki:
What...
beautiful music...!!!
It sends chills down
my spine just playing it!

Nikki:
I knew you'd like it!

Nikki learned

Ash:
I have a baaaaaad
feeling about this...
This is the place.
Riddel has a ton of alternate lines here. What triggers them?
Dario:
I have a feeling I have lost
someone very dear to me...

We live a quiet,
humble life here.

Please leave us in peace.


Riddel:
This cannot be...
Are you...Dario!?
But of course you are.
This is another world.
You are alive and well
in this world!

Riddel:
If only there was something
to reawaken your memory...
Yes, I know.
This pendant.

Riddel:
Yes, Dario.
You do not remember me?
I may be the Riddel
from another world, but
every day, I have always...
And yet you do not
remember who I am?

Dario:
Riddel...?
That name moves my heart...
I have a feeling I have lost
someone very dear to me...

Riddel:
If only there was something
to reawaken your memory...
Yes, I know.
Take a look at this.

Riddel:
If only there was something
to reawaken your memory...
Yes, I know.
Your mother's memento,
which you gave to me...
That may help you remember.

He might remember something
if we bring Miss Riddel here!

I don't know what to
believe anymore.
There's been so much going on,
and I'm just so confused...

Leena:
This is turning into
a real big mess.
But we can't give up!
We can't just let it happen!

Huaaaaaah...
What? I don't have
any business with
you demi-humans.
If I were to let you
on my boat, I might end
up waking up the dead.
I'm very superstitious,
you know.
How do you think I lived
to be this age?

Zzzz...
Zzzzzzz...?

Hello, young 'un.
Great day, huh?
How goes it?
You want to go to
Water Dragon Isle...?
Now why would you
want to do that?
The springs have dried up,
and there's nothing left.
There ain't no way I'm
taking you there.

.........

.........
OK, so why don'tCHA
get back to work.

Actually, my bro
gave me the idea.
Still, I'm doin' all I can to
become a fine chef like my bro!

Tasty...! CHA-CHA-CHA!
Healthy...! CHA-CHA-CHA!
Why don'tCHA try
my Heckran soup!

Yo, Serge.
You want to hear about
them group of thieves up
on the mainland again?

~~~Not interested
~~~Tell me!

Fine.
Maybe next time I'll
tell you about the
birds and the bees.

Well, OK...
Don't fall asleep
on me now.
Listen up.
In the past several years,
a group of thieves has been
causing havoc over on the
mainland.
They're cold-blooded
bastards.
They'll go to any extreme
to get money or jewels.
Even the powerful nation
of Porre can't seem to
get a hold of them.
I think they call themselves
the Radical Dreamers...
Wouldn't want to run into
those bandits...

Looks like the Viper Festival
will be cancelled again this year.
Our only celebration of El Nido
Archipelago, down the drain...
There hasn't been anything
good to talk about since
the army from Porre took
over the islands 3 years ago.
We wouldn't have to put
up with this situation if
General Viper and the
dragoons were still here...

Anyway, we're all more or
less crazy down here....
Muwahahaha...

.........
You're fired.

......
............
..................

.........
Get back to work now,
you hear?

It really doesn't matter
whether I was writing
poems or not.
Nobody would give a hoot
about someone writing poems
from a tiny little...

Even if you look away,
reality won't disappear,
you know.
No matter how hard you
try to fool yourself,
reality is going to
catch up with you.

What's that?
A Komodo dragon scale?
It's actually prettier
than I thought.

Maybe we need to loosen up
and take heed of the
simple beauties in life.
We should all live in
harmony with reality.

Yo, stranger.
You want to hear about
them group of thieves up on
the mainland again?

~~~No, thanks
~~~Sure!

Fine.
Well, take care of yourself,
and watch out for them
Radical Dreamers!

Yeah, I wouldn't blame you.
It's disturbing, isn't it...
Alright then, listen up.
In the past several years,
a group of thieves have been
causing havoc over on the
mainland.
They're cold-blooded
bastards.
They'll go to any extreme
to get money or jewels.
Even the powerful nation
of Porre can't seem to
get a hold of them.
I think they call themselves
the Radical Dreamers...
Wouldn't want to run into
those bandits...

Anyway, we're all more or
less crazy down here....
Muwahahaha...:

You heard a divine message?
To give your prayers
to the 3 spirits?
Actually, I bought these
3 idols bundled with Mojo
for a really good price.
I think the merchant also
said something about
telling the idols about most
precious thing in your life.
Why don't you give your
prayers to the 3 idols, too?
Along with Mojo?

I couldn't believe it
when Mojo actually
moved and talked...
But...
What has the past
10 years meant to me...?

Sorry, but I don't have
time for you right now.
I'm praying for the sake
of world love and piece of mind.

But no one was here
to accept the prayers
from Membre000...

Poshul:
Y-You thcared I!
R-Ret'th jutht get
a move on to the beach!
Sick Girl's house
I've had it up to here
with all these soldiers
running around day and night.

Mama,
it's Serge,
it's Serge!!!

Don't worry, dear.
Sir Lynx will help us!

 [John]
   Serge!
   I'm sorry about the other day.
   I heard that the other guy
   was the evil Serge!
   But wait, so there's two
   Serges running around?
   What's going on??

I'm so sorry, Korcha.
I must have misundertood
you all this time.
I finally sat down to listen
this child talk about you...

Korcha:
......

Please continue to play
with her from time to time...

Korcha...
Will you go out with
your beautiful boat
and search for my
father someday?

Korcha:
Uh, s-sure.

It's a promise!

Yeah!
I better go now, or mom
will get worried.
Remember, we made a promise!

Yes!
Ohh...
My poor Skelly...
I pray that you
are safe...

Skelly:
......

Skelly,
do be careful.
If you're going to be long,
do write me how you are
doing.

Grandma,
it is Sir Lynx.

The laughter and
the liveliness that
this town was once proud
of had disappeared...
I wonder what will
become of us...

Skelly:
!
Serge.,
you're still alive!?
I would love ta help ya,
but I've broken a few
too many bones from the
impact!
It'll take quite some time
to get me straightened out...

Zappa:
That laddie, dinnae ken how
ah've worried about him...
He's probably embarassed to
show his face 'round here.
That bloody...
Ah wonder who he takes after?

Zippa:
Oh, Karsh!
Ye brought Karsh
back to us!
Ohh, Karsh...
Yir safety's all ah
ever hoped for...

Karsh:
Mom...

Zappa:
Mah apologies...
The shop's already closed.
There's nothing left here but
auld memories. If ye've no got
business with yours truly, git
out of here.urs truly, git

Zappa:
Take yir business up
to the counter, ken?

Zappa:
......
Ye be needin' somethin'?

Zippa:
The rumors about the
'"rainbow"' were real...
Mah hubby's gone head over
heals forging the rainbow.
He disnae want tae even waste
time eating.
Whew, men just never grow up!

Pierre:
Snicker... Just as I thought,
monsieurs are like the
trois stooges without moi!

Pierre:
You are Serge.!!!
Oh, what have you done to
incur god's wrath, to be
transformed into a beast
with such poor fur...
Ohh, how can this be...
Yet there is nothing that
moi can do for you...
Oh, what a crying shame...

Pierre:
The Porre military shall surely
greet moi with a hero's welcome
into their arms...

Pierre:
008Snicker...000
Just as I thought, you
are no good without moi!

Pierre:
The fate of the thieves that
disappeared into the dark...
How pitiful...
If a hero like moi had been
there, moi could have prevented
such a tragedy from ever
occuring...

Pierre:
If only moi had this medal
a petite earlier...

Pierre:
Such a magnifique and elegante
sword, perfect for moi...
Yet it is too heavy to wield...

Hey!
Are you two listening to me?
Gee wiz...
Alternate line below
Greco:
Please call me whenever
you wish for my help,
amigo.

Greco:
Interesting...
Your body and soul seem to be
separate entities...
Perhaps you are now drifting
between the boundaries
of life and death...
You are too young to be taken
into the arms of darkness.
Although it is in my best
interest to aid you, my duty is
to watch over the spirits here.
I wonder when we will have peace
and quiet back in Termina...

???
There are two Mikis...?
Maybe you two can debut
as '"The Punk Ladies!"'

Miki:
Oh, cut that out! Don't you
ever think about anything
other than making money?

Nikki's been spotted
going into Shadow Forest.
I'm counting on you!

I wonder if Miki's alright
by herself...

Miki:
Have you changed your mind?
~~~OK, let's do it
~~~Wait a minute

Miki:
Mm-mmm, the makeup's
shining bright today!

Miki:
Right on!

Miki:
!?
The mirror spoke back?

Viper Manor, I *think*...

Something's in the way!

Pa's inside here!

But a monster's blocking
the way, and he can't get out!

Papa...!!!

Phew...
You saved me.
(Alternate harle line, possibly unused)
Harle:
I know not'ing.

Dario:
I do not know how many
years it will take, but
I will rebuild Viper Manor.

Karsh:
Bring it on!

There's a sinkhole below

Zzzz... Zzzz...

Glenn:
Zzzz... Huh...?

Glenn:
Huh? Zzzz...

Glenn:
Ergh... Zzzz...
There's a switch.
~~~Push it
~~~Don't push it

There's something
blocking the way.

Luccia:
I see you are
vith Pip.

GA-BI-BI...?
I have orders not to
let anyone through.
The investigation is
complete, so we should
be withdrawing soon.

I have orders not to let anyone through.

Commander Norris's
superior officer has been
sent back to the mainland.
I'm glad we got that
jerk out of here.

This manor is now occupied
by the Porre military.

Sir!
All is well, sir!
Viper Manor Library
It's not working now.
What must you do to get the Nu to say this?

...Y-Y-You cannot
change your name.

Doc:
Fate handed down by god
is a merciless thing.
But is there no way to grant
her a small reprise?
To have separated the sisters,
only to face such a result...?

Doc:
...Dude, what are you
stressing about?
Your own strength,
or the unavoidable reality?

Doc:
I don't know who you are, but
how would you know how I feel?
You don't know me...

Doc:
...I understand.
I understand so much it hurts,
because you are the other me...

Doc:
!? What is going on...?
Who are you, dude?
Can you really be me?

Doc:
Death is the total wipeout.
All life must face death
eventually...
There is no escaping it.
But, because life has limits,
we can live strongly to the
very end.
Is that not right, dude?

Doc:
Yes...I know that.
That is something I knew
from the beginning...

Death is the great equalizer
to all on this planet...
I understand this, but...

Th-There are two doctors...!?
You two aren't brothers...are you?
What is going on...?
Is this an illusion?

Doc:
As gnarly as it seems,
this is reality.
Let me just say that
there are many
alternate worlds...
Even in different worlds,
you are you, and I am me.
Just remember that. Take care
of the other doctor for me...

Y-Yes, doctor...

Korcha:
Oh, it's you guys.
How ya doin'?
Sailin' is great, I tell ya!

Huh? Who...!?

Korcha:
Wh-Why am I standin'
over there!?
What the hell's goin' on here?

Korcha:
Don't worry about such
trivial things.
There ain't no use thinkin'
up an explanation anyway!

Korcha:
...Do you really think it's trivial?
But I have to agree that there's
no way of explainin' this.

Korcha:
Don't worry, don't worry.
Let's try not to use our heads
beyond our limited capacities!

Korcha:
...I don't think that's somethin'
you should be sayin' to yourself.
Oh, never mind...
Korcha:
Yo, Serge.
Nobody's called me lately,
so it's been very relaxin'!
Oh yeah, I've gotta give these
back to you before I forget.
They're the Elements that
Mel stole a while back.
I gave her a good scoldin' for it!
It's just childish mischief, so
give her a break, OK?

You received all of
Kid's stolen Elements!

Korcha:
Yo, Serge..
Nobody's called me lately,
so it's been very relaxin'!
And take it easy with that
boat I lentCHA.
Don't forget, it's my
favorite boat, you hear?

Korcha:
Didja need something today?
~~~Not really
~~~Come and join me

Korcha:
Ah, man, you're leavin' me
behind again? My ma makes me
do a lotta chores when I'm here.
You guys have my boat, so I
can't leave the village, either...
C'mon, Serge., do me a favor
and take me with you next time,
alright?

Korcha:
Good timing.
I've been bored to death!
Time to hit the open seas again!

Korcha:
...Left behind again.
Don'tCHA think that's
a bit cruel?

Korcha:
Huh? Who are you guys?
I've never seen you before,
are you ma's friends?
Oh, I don't care.
Sorry, but I'm not in a
mood to talk to strangers.
Could ya leave me alone?

~Korcha joinedCHA party!

Korcha:
You are...Serge.?
You survived...

Korcha:
...Sorry.
I don't know if I should be
rejoicin' or panickin' right now.
My head's still screwed from
tryin' to sort out what
happened back there.
You are who you say, but...
I just can't figure it all out yet.

Korcha:
Wh-Who are you!?
Huh? You say you're Serge.?
Are you crazy?
That guy was human.
No matter how I look at you,
you're a demi-human.
That's a terrible joke,
if you're tryin' to be funny..

Korcha's, ma:
Oh my, who are you?
You're an interesting visitor.
Are you here to see my son?
He's upstairs if you need him.
There isn't much here,
but feel right at home.

~Macha joinedCHA party!

Macha:
You are alright, Serge..
I'm sorry I wasn't of any help
to you...
But I am relieved to see you
alive and well.
Unfortunately, I have lost
my cool.
I don't think I'll be of any use
like this...so I can't help you
out yet. I'm so sorry.

Macha:
Wh-Who are you!?
Huh, Serge. you say?
Don't be ridiculous!
Keep such foolish jokes to
yourself!
If you've got time to be playing
around, go find some work to do!
Gosh, you must be drunk or
something...
Mel:
Hey, hey, Serge..
Take me with you!
I'll be much more useful than
my big brother! I'm not kiddin'!
It'll be OK, I swear.
Pleeease.

Mel:
Huh?
You're not with blondie
today, Sergey?

Mel:
Mel doesn't have a
catman as her friend.
Are you here to see big brother?
Big brother should be upstairs.
...But it's the first time I've
seen a catman.
Didja come from the mainland?

Mel:
Mel returned all of the
Elements to my big brother,
so don't be mad at me.

Mel:
...Oh, rats.
Mel has to stay behind?
That's no fun!

Mel:
...Oh, rats.
Mel has to stay behind?
That's no fun!

Mel:
...Oh!?
You're...alive.
It's a good thing...right?
Whoops...
Mel can't tell what's
right or wrong right now.
I know you're still Serge.,
even if your body's different,
but...
Sorry, Serge..
I'm still too confused...
I haven't been able to
sort out my feelings yet...

Mel:
Hey! You're not supposed to
come into other people's houses!
Isn't that common sense?
Huh? Serge.?
...Are you alright, Mr. Catman?
Mel's friend Serge., is
human!!!
Don't go tryin' to tell jokes
that aren't even funny.
You should try to be a little
more honest, too.
Bye-bye, Mr. Catman.

Mel:
Oh, blondie!
Um, I have somethin' that I
wanted to discuss with you...

Kid:
...Huh?
Ya need to talk to me?
Go ahead, speak up.

Mel:
Umm, Mel would like
to speak to you in
private if possible...

Kid:
Sure, whatever.
That's fine with me.

Kid:
...So, what didja want
to talk to me about?

Mel:
Actually,000 I,000 um000...000...
...000...
...000...

Kid:
Sure, you got it!
This problem was drivin'
me up the wall, too!
Mel, I understand yer
feelings reeeeal well!
'"Don'tCHA worry."'
I won't get in yer way.

Mel:
Thank you, Kid!
Then please take
Mel with you!

Korcha:
...Hey, whatCHA talkin' about?
Come on and tell us, too.

Kid:
No way. This is strictly a
woman to woman thing!
Sorry, but I ain't gonna tell ya.

Korcha:
Huh?  WhatCHA mean by that?
Nevermind that, it's gonna get
noisy with Mel joinin' us...

~Mel joinedCHA your party!

Mel:
Oh, and Kid!
Take this as a token of
our promise.
It's a special frame
made in Guldove called,
'"Guldovian Stitch."'
It's got a cool lookin' pattern
so I'm sure you'll like it!

Kid received the
'"Guldovian Stitch"' frame!

Steena:
The power of the ancient
Dragon Gods shall guide
you to the Sea of Eden...

Steena:
May the lost Goddess of Fate
bless the children of the
planet...

Doc:
Dragonians and dragon lore...
It all sounded like fiction
to someone like me from the
mainland.
That is, until something like that
occured in front of my eyes...
I still want to believe that
it was all just a bad dream...
It will take time to fully accept
it all as a reality...
I am sorry, Serge..
I cannot rejoin you just yet.

Doc:
Try not to take too many risks.
One can only live strongly
because life is limited!

Doc:
It has been a long time
since that incident.
From your story, I can tell that
you were able to meet her...
But it seems you have not heard
the details of what happened.
Perhaps it is in our best
interest that I tell you
how she was saved.

Doc:
Shortly after you left, a young
traveler who happened to have
Hydra Humour visited the village.
Thanks to him, we were able
to save her life...
A few days after the poison
was completely neutralized,
she left for the main island.
Her destination was
Fort Dragonia...
and that is where you
saw her again.

Doc:
But now, her whereabouts
are unknown again...
I must say, your travels are
far from trouble-free, dude.

Doc:
It has been a while
since I saw you last.
Were you able to meet her?

Doc:
So you were able to find her...
I am glad to hear that.
I must apologize for my
conduct back then.
My shortcomings as a doctor
has caused you much trouble.


Doc:
   I know the Dragon Tear
   changed Serge into this
   form at Fort Dragonia, but...
   I saw it happen with my
   own eyes, and I still
   cannot believe it...

Along with the dwarves, you'll
find other monsters in this forest.
I know you think you're strong and
all, but just don't wander off too far!

Razzly:
I really wish I could go
back to my home island soon...
I wonder how everyone's doing?

Razzly:
So the Dragon Tear
changed Serge. into
your current form...?
I'm fairy sorry, Serge..
I'm so confused right now,
I can't be of much help.
But one of these days...

Razzly:
Huh!? Who are you!?
What!? Serge....!?
You shouldn't tell lies.
Serge. is human.
You look nothing like him!
Tee-hee!
Take care, Mr. Demi-human!

Don't worry.
They're all very
understandin'.
Oh, and the ones who ran
off are back onboard.
Pay them a visit when
you get a chance.

Fargo:
   NO!!!
   There's no escape!

Fargo:
   You ready!?
   ~~~All set!
   ~~~Just a minute!
Fargo:
So you're all talk, eh!?
Arg! Stick these land-
lubbers in the hold!

Fargo:
I thought you would've
put up a better fight...
Arg! Stick these land-
lubbers in the hold!

Fargo:
Huh? What?

Fargo:
Well, then...

I didn't think we'd
end up in the same ship.
Well, you never know what
to expect in life.

Ahoy, mateys!
Where's that lively,
young blondie?
What!?
She's in a coma!?
Th-That's terrible!
What the hell are ya
doin' here!?
You should be by her side!

Show some respect
to Cap'n Fargo!

No use hiding it!
So you're tryin' ta track
down information, eh?
Here's a little tip.
People need fire
to survive.
So, if ya see any smoke
puffin' out from somewhere,
go check it out.

I can't be of much help,
but good luck to ya.

Ho ho ho and
a bottle of rum!

If only we had a good
relish to go with it.

Orcha:
Don'tCHA know you can't
fight when you're hungry?

Orcha:
Looks like this is it...
You'll do fine!
You've been eatin' my food,
haven'tCHA!?
CHA-HA-HA-HA!
Arg...!
With so many people onboard,
we're stuck in here!

The other day during
my watch duty,
I sprained my ankle and
couldn't run anymore.
That really sucked.
You gotta take care
of that real quick.

We're packed like
sardines in here!
And it's all because of them!
But...
Riddel and Marcy
can stay.
Everyone else, leave!

Nikki:
Oh...
It's...nothing...

Nikki:
Mind if I ask
you something...?

Nikki:
It's about the other world...
Is Zelbess...?

Nikki:
Hm?
Oh...
Yeah, sure.

Nikki:

Rockin'.
It'd be nice to
have more people
listen to my songs.

Nikki:
Including Marcy.

Nikki:
Oh, and one more thing...

Nikki:
If you didn't call this ship
the S.S. Invincible...
What would you have called it?
The same name the other you
called it in the other world?

Nikki:

(Har-har!)

All:
Aye-aye, Cap'n!!!
SS Invincible

Fargo:
Keep it up, Serge!!!
It's comin'!s Kid?
Has she snapped out of it yet?

Karsh:
Yo, what up, Serge.!
What am I doin',
you ask?
I'm here by Lady Riddel's
side, protectin' her from
scum...
I'm her personal bodygua...
Ahhh...nothing!

Never in my life did I
expect to encounter a
real ghost ship!
Gah-haha-ha!

Riddel Groupie:
Damn!
I-I-I can't get close to her.

Fargo:
Listen up.
I've explained yer
situation to me men.
Don't worry. They're all
very understandin'.
Oh, and the ones who ran
off are back onboard.
Pay them a visit when
you get a chance.

Fargo:
Ahoy, mateys!
Make yerselves at home.

Fargo:
I've got a bad feelin' 'bout this...
Let's just get it over with.

Kid:
Not you again!!!

Harle:
What are you doing,
Monsieur Lynx!?
She iz mon ennemie!
And, she iz not ze
Kid you know!

Harle:
Tsk, tsk, tsk!

L:00148.H:00003)
Harle:
Pleaze, Serge.
Turn back now.

Harle:
She iz not'ing
but bad luck!
She will bring
not'ing but misfortune
to your life.

Old Man:
Actually, I see that you are not.
It must have been that munchkin
that just flew away.

Old Man:
Miss Riddel had informed me
that Lynx and the general
were heading to Fort Dragonia.
I played it safe and went
into hiding for a while...
And it looks like Lynx did
pay me a visit.
I'm sure the general has
no idea what happened here.
Lynx is the one behind all this.

Old Man:
I had a feeling
something like this
might happen...
That is why I made
sure to build a sturdy
stronghold underground.
I believe it should
still be intact.

Old Man:
Are you here to
ask me questions?
Come, there's no
need to be shy.

Radius:
It's you, Serge..
What is it today?

Radius:
Don't you have more
important things to do?

Radius:
Is she awake!?
Oh, thank goodness...
Thank goodness...

The Chrono Cross begins to shimmer.

w.a.itsuffixe, Serge.!

Harle:
Serge...


Radius:
Where are you going?
We must stay put for now.

Riddel:
Hah-ha...
You have an interesting way
of cheering someone up.

Membre 2:

Water Dragon:
O, thou son of man,
bound by the Goddess of Fate...
Welcome to this land.
The time has cometh to
unleash the powers of the
Sleeping Dragons, yet...
Thou must again cross
dimensions to accomplish
one last errand.

Water Dragon:
So sad it may be that
this is also the destiny of one
bounded by fate...

It's rusted and won't open...
So, what'd you think?

Be my guest.

Now that the captain's
gone, what are we
supposed to do?
Maybe we should lend our
hands to the restoration
of Marbule...?

Damn demi-humans...!
They got away, right
under our noses!
We have to do somethin'
before the captain finds out...

Oh, a Nikki otaku!
You look just like him!

008Sigh...000
The concert's over...
I was a bit disappointed that he
didn't play any of his old stuff...
But at least I was able
to see Nikki live!

Oh...Nikki...
Why is it that you always
feel so far away from me...?
Strangely, though, you feel
very close today...

Oh...Nikki...
Why are you feeling so
melancholy today...?
Can't you see I'm here
for you? Oh...Nikki...!

Tch!
What the hell was that
concert all about!?
I thought it was supposed
to be a head-bangin' gig!?
What a letdown!

So you're Nikki...!
Wow... You're the man!
Your performance really
brought back fond memories
of my mother...
008Sniff...000
Time to go home...

Sneff:
You had me worried sick...!!!
I had to lie down a bit
because I strained
my back running...

Sneff:
You had me worried...!!!
I had to lie down a bit
because I strained my back
running...
I'm sorry, ffolks.
Actually, there's absolutely
no trick behind that magic.
An old troll gave me a
mysterious berry during
my travels, long ago.
She was saying someffing
about the Bend of Time...
Anyway, affter I ate the berry,
I was able to transfform people
into cats.
I wish I could change you
back to your human fform,
but my achin' back...
I'll need to lie down a bit,
so you'll have to stay that
way ffor a while.
I hope you understand...

Zzzz... Zzzz...
Zzzz... Zzzz...

I gotta give it to him...
Pops still has it,
even at his age.
Don't know when he'll start
feeling better, though...
Don't worry about it.
I'll be sure to feed you.

We have to get
the timing down!

Pops traveled the world
on his skills alone.
He really does deserve
more respect...

But Pops has that
'"you know what..."'

Oh yeah...
If only he didn't have
that '"you know what..."'

We're gonna shake it!

Actually, old man Sneff has
a considerably considerable
amount of debt to Captain Fargo.
That is precisely why he
cannot leave this ship.

W-We're gonna do our best
to shake laughter out of
as many people as we can!

Old man Sneff is always
shakin' it into debt
with his gambling...
Gambling is about the
only joy in his life.
I-It's kinda sad...

Sorry, folks.
Just hang in there.

Well, I guess we're up!
We have to fill in for
Pops, too!!!

Sneff:
I'm really sorry, ffolks...
I just need to lie
down ffor a bit.
You'll have to play
cat and mouse ffor a while...

Sneff:
Contrary to my liffestyle now,
I used to travel the
world perfforming magic
when I was young.
The sensation off amazing
an audience wiff my
perfformance...
Wiff the audiences eyes ffixed
right on me, you could almost
cut the tension wiff a kniffe...
I ffelt as though I could hear
every one of them, swallowing
in anticipation...
It takes me back to the
good ol' days just by
closing my eyes...

Sneff:
Sorry, I'm sure I must be
boring you wiff my past...
But I tell you, it is so
great to be young.
There are inffinite possibilities.
Well anyway, 10 shows per day
is taking a toll on my old body.
I'm really tired, so I'm gonna
hit the sack.
Don't go wandering outside
looking like that.
I don't wanna be held responsible
should anyffing happen to you.
I am lanky Lank!

A-And...
I'm Stout!

Shake it!!!

...And enjoy our show!!!

Sneff:
How about we start offf wiff
my '"Cat on a Hot Tin Rooff,"'
today!?
Do I have a volunteer
ffrom the audience?

Ladies and gentlemen,
a knife show,
by '"Fat and Slim!"'

Oh, you seem excited.

H-Hey!

I thought they were a joke
at first, but you start
liking them after a while!

Ohhh!

That was fun!
I like this place!

Fargo:
I don't know what
your scheme is, but
it doesn't concern me.
It's in your hands now...

Fargo:
Viper...
You're still alive!!!?

Viper:
Fargo...
Nothing will ever change if
you do not face up to reality.

Fargo:
......

Fargo:
Nikki...
Your ship has
already departed.
What's on your mind?

Fargo:
Hasn't the concert
started yet, Nikki?
The crowd is waiting anxiously.
Stop worrying about
trivial matters and
get on with the show.

Nikki:
......

Fargo:
Luccia...
If what Irenes says
is true, then I have
misunderstood you.

Luccia:
yes...
I do not blame you.
All you can do now is
gently embrace your
daughter, Marcy.

Fargo:
Yes...

Fargo:
Marcy?
So, you're Marcy...!?
Hahhahah...
You have your mother's eyes!

Marcy:
......
Like...who are you?
And how do you know
my mom?

Fargo:
I can't say now, but
you'll find out eventually.

Marcy:
......
There's somethin'
fishy about you!
The gamblers dont come back after you lose!
You cats wouldn't understand
the pleasure of gambling...

Not bad, guys!
You must be pretty lucky to
beat the captain like that!
Huh?
Luck is a big part of skill?
Heheh, you're probably right!
You crack me up...

You have no chance of
winnin' against the captain.
He's never lost a game.

I can't believe the
captain lost...

I can't imagine the captain
pulling a scam...
But it makes you wonder
with his winning record.

I thought I would be
the first to beat the
captain...
Good job, guys...
008(Listen...uhhh...
 So what's the secret
 to beating him? Huh?
 Tell me...please?)000

I'm really glad the captain
cleared my debt today.
It was getting out of hand.
Be careful and keep your
head above water.
Or else you'll end up like
old man Sneff here.

Nikki:
That was a rockin' jam session!
It'd be great if we could
tour together some time!

Nikki:
Yeah...!

Nikki:
......!?
Another me...?
Hey, I'd love to jam
with you some time...!
How 'bout it!?

Nikki:
Sure, that'd be great...!
You know our mother's song,
right? Teach it to me?

Nikki:
Sure thing...!

Nikki:
What...
beautiful music...!!!
It sends chills down
my spine just playing it!

Nikki:
I knew you'd like it!

Nikki learned
003Item000
from a jam session with Nikki!
Ash:
I have a baaaaaad
feeling about this...
This is the place.
Riddel has a ton of alternate lines here. What triggers them?
Dario:
I have a feeling I have lost
someone very dear to me...

We live a quiet,
humble life here.

Please leave us in peace.


Riddel:
This cannot be...
Are you...Dario!?
But of course you are.
This is another world.
You are alive and well
in this world!

Riddel:
If only there was something
to reawaken your memory...
Yes, I know.
This pendant.

Riddel:
Yes, Dario.
You do not remember me?
I may be the Riddel
from another world, but
every day, I have always...
And yet you do not
remember who I am?

Dario:
Riddel...?
That name moves my heart...
I have a feeling I have lost
someone very dear to me...

Riddel:
If only there was something
to reawaken your memory...
Yes, I know.
Take a look at this.

Riddel:
If only there was something
to reawaken your memory...
Yes, I know.
Your mother's memento,
which you gave to me...
That may help you remember.

Glenn:
What can we do!?
I know!
He might remember something
if we bring Miss Riddel here!
